<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="mt"></a>!MANAGE THIS!</h2>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> my thanks to the public relations department at Sanitarium Health Food for allowing me to reprint this instructive case history from Australia, reminiscent of the Odwalla and Tylenol recalls in the U.S.</i>
<p><b>Sanitarium Health Food Contamination Threat</b></p>
<p>Sanitarium Health Food Company received a letter threatening contamination of its 'liquid products' on the morning of Monday, 29 June 1998. It was, in the words of CEO Robert Smith, "every food company's worst nightmare".
<p>Fortunately, Sanitarium had a crisis management plan in place. Within an hour its Emergency Response Team was meeting and making decisions. The ERT comprised five senior managers - the CEO, Chief Operating Officer, General Manager-Sales & Marketing, General Manager-Technical Services and Public Relations Manager. ERT meetings were also attended by two crisis management experts from The Rowland Company, Sanitarium's public relations consultancy.
<p>The first task was to establish the facts and to seek advice from the Police and Medical authorities. Although expert advice was that the risk was remote, the ERT decided that consumer safety had to be the number one priority. The Company therefore instituted an immediate national recall of all its beverage products - So Good, Up&Go and Fruit Juices - from supermarket shelves.
<p>The first 24 hours of the crisis were spent making key decisions and organising communications to staff, retailers, other business partners and the public (via the media). The response from the trade was prompt and efficient with the major supermarket chains completing the recall within hours of being notified.
<p>Sanitarium's CEO travelled from the Company's headquarters in Berkeley Vale, Central Coast to Sydney to handle media interviews. The story was the lead item on TV news in the evening and there was heavy print and radio coverage for the next few days. In addition to all the editorial coverage, product recall advertisements were placed in the major metropolitan newspapers.
<p>According to tracking research 80 per cent of Australians were aware of the recall by the end of the first week. The consumer hotline received 12,000 enquires, necessitating an overflow facility with an external service provider.
<p>After the initial public announcement the ERT continued to meet daily to share information such as staff, trade and consumer feedback, media updates, further updates from the police, to make decisions and to approve further communications.
<p>The focus of attention moved to what Sanitarium was doing to check its products and when they would return. This was of particular concern to many lactose intolerant people who rely on dairy alternatives such as So Good, the leading brand of soy milk in Australia.
<p>An interim media announcement was made to communicate that Sanitarium was conducting an exhaustive inspection and testing process, involving over 300,000 recalled items which would then be destroyed. Only then would the Company be prepared to bring its products back to supermarket shelves.
<p>The ERT had also formed a special Back to Market team to ensure a successful return of the beverage products to supermarket shelves, dealing with manufacturing, logistics, distribution, trade and customer information.
<p>An integrated communications campaign was developed, including a series of TV and press ads featuring CEO Robert Smith who had been the public face of the Company throughout the crisis. And on 17 July a media conference was held to announce the return of Sanitarium beverages to supermarket shelves.
<p>520 editorial media items were generated during the course of the crisis, providing over 73 million opportunities to see, hear, or read about Sanitarium. The coverage was fair, accurate, and sympathetic towards the Company.
<p>Sanitarium has estimated the cost of the recall and disposal of withdrawn stock at $1-2m, plus a further $2m in lost sales. However, the financial considerations were secondary to consumer safety and the safeguarding of the Company's reputation as an ethical, customer focused organisation.
<p>According to tracking research 95 per cent said that consumer safety was the reason for the recall, 92 per cent said they trusted Sanitarium and 90 per cent said they considered Sanitarium had handled the recall well or very well.

<p><i>Major Terrorism Events & Terrorism Timeline</i>
<br><b>by Claire B. Rubin et al</b>
<p>For those of us who choose to learn from the experiences of others, "Major Terrorism Events and Their U.S. Outcomes," a white paper offered through George Washington University's Institute for Crisis, Disaster, and Risk Management is a wise investment of $20. It provides lessons learned from an examination and analysis of terrorism acts and major disasters over the past two decades. Not surprisingly to those of us who are crisis managers, many of the "gee, I should have thought of that" lessons from 9/11 were also readily available through previous experiences.  The publisher also offers a four-color graphic outline of the various crises available for a mere $5 more.  Order at <a href="http://www.disaster-timeline.com" target="_blank">http://www.disaster-timeline.com</a>.
<p><b>2002 Crisis Communications White Paper</b>
<p>The 2002 Crisis Communications White Paper from Best Practices in Business Communications does a remarkably good job, in 60 pages, of summarizing the state of crisis communications today. The changes in practice and consciousness that have been prompted by both corporate disasters and the horrendous lessons of 9/11.  It includes instructional and educational material on crisis preparedness, management and analysis.
<p>Some of the report's sections include:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Nine Steps to Crisis Preparation, Management, and Analysis</li>
<p><li>What Crises Challenge Corporate Communications?</li>
<p><li>Terrorism</li>
<p><li>Market Upheavals</li>
<p><li>Shareholder Uncertainty</li>
<p><li>Leadership Turnover</li>
<p><li>Mergers and Acquisitions failure</li>
<p><li>Product Recalls</li>
<p><li>Environmental Accidents</li>
<p><li>Workplace Violence</li>
<p><li>Natural Disasters</li>
<p><li>Importance of Top-Down Crisis Management</li>
<p><li>Best Practice Media Relations Tactics</li>
<p><li>Branding and Crisis Management</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus four case histories about how some leading companies adjusted in the days after 9/11.  Given the length of the white paper, no single subject gets a large amount of ink, but this publication would be an excellent primer for any CEO or head of corporate communications.
<p><i>The 2002 Crisis Communications White paper, $100 for PRSA members, $150.00 for non-members.  Non-members purchase at <a href="http://www.bpincc.com/shopcart/product.asp?intProdID=6" target="_blank">http://www.bpincc.com/shopcart/product.asp?intProdID=6</a>, PRSA members have to call Shane McLaughlin, 202.463.3780, to place their discounted order.</i>
<p><b>Disaster Recovery Yellow Pages</b>
<p>The 2003 edition of the Disaster Recovery Yellow Pages from the Systems Audit Group (<a href="http://www.disaster-help.com" target="_blank">www.disaster-help.com</a>) is exactly as named: a 300-page compendium of approximately 3,000 paid listings from organizations providing disaster-related support services in 255 categories.  It is an excellent starting point for identifying the vendors who could serve your organization before, during or after a disaster -- something you'd best do now, not when the building is falling down.
<p>It is important to note that there is no way to tell anything about the quality of the advertisers' services simply from a directory.  You must do your research and check references.  I have heard very positive overall feedback from individuals who purchased last year's edition.
<p>Finally, the publishers are offering "Crisis Manager" readers 10% off the purchase price -- normally $98 for either the hard copy or CD-ROM version, with further discount for ordering both and/or bulk orders.  If you want the "Crisis Manager" discount, you must send email with your phone number to <a href="mailto:&#100&#105&#115&#97&#115&#116&#101&#114&#64&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#110&#101&#119&#115&#108&#101&#116&#116&#101&#114&#46&#99&#111&#109">&#100&#105&#115&#97&#115&#116&#101&#114&#64&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#110&#101&#119&#115&#108&#101&#116&#116&#101&#114&#46&#99&#111&#109</a> and someone from Systems Audit Group will contact you to manually process your order (their online order system doesn't currently accommodate special discount offers).
