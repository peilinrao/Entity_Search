<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> I have been fascinated by the results of the PRSA Economic Confidence Study done by Equation Research, completed in August 2002.

A number of findings are very significant for those who seek to prevent or minimize business reputation crises and I will start to report those in this issue, continuing in future issues. The first finding wasn't ranked this way in the survey -- they just gave the raw results and mean scores.  Look at where company officials rank! And at who is considered more credible about company financial info.</i>

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Crisis Manager reader Charlie McDonald wrote to me earlier this month suggesting that we run articles on crisis simulation, the vital "testing" element of crisis preparedness. I said "good idea, you want to write one?"  Charlie and I both know that there's a lot more to say on this subject -- he edited his original 3,600-word piece down to what you see below -- and I've asked my resident simulation guru, Phil Cogan, to give you a follow-up article soon.</i>
<p><b>A Little Exercise Keeps Your Crisis Management Organization in Shape</b><br><i>by Charles McDonald</i></p>
<p><p>Crisis management planning is important for all types of companies. Crisis management professionals have known this all along; now many corporations are developing plans for the first time or revisiting plans with a new eye towards previously unacknowledged threats. But after planning, an additional step is required to ensure an organization can successfully respond to a crisis -- the exercise program. Without regular exercises, crisis management plans will do little to help in a crisis, and can even provide a false sense of preparedness. It is the experience gained in crisis exercises that builds a company's response capabilities. The types of exercises used to improve crisis response capabilities are briefly described below.
<p><b>Notification and Activation</b>
<p>This exercise tests the company's ability to:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Receive information about a potential crisis</li>
<p><li>Assess its impact and determine the response level warranted</li>
<p><li>Activate the crisis teams, i.e., find them and get them to the crisis room.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are done off-hours to assess call out procedures and determine how long it takes to assemble the teams in their assigned areas. The drill begins with a call to the identified crisis response number and ends when the team is assembled. These drills are simple to design and conduct and should be run at least twice a year.
<p><b>The Tabletop</b>
<p>The objectives of this type of exercise are to:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Provide crisis teams with experience in executing the plans in a learning environment, without the pressure of a real-time exercise.</li>
<p><li>Develop an understanding of the team's role in the overall corporate response.</li>
<p><li>In multi-team exercises, test team integration and identify gaps and overlaps in roles.</li>
<p><li>Identify areas where additional work is indicated. During assessment, four possibilities exist for each issue and role.</li>

<ol start="1" type="1">
<p><li>Response was effective and plan was followed (desired result)</li>
<p><li>Response was effective but plan was not followed (plan needs revision)</li>
<p><li>Response was ineffective but plan was followed (plan needs revisions)</li>
<p><li>Response was ineffective and plan was not followed (training needed -- plan revision may be needed)</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<p>A tabletop exercise is a pre-scheduled meeting. Notification and activation are not tested.  Facilities and equipment are not involved. A tabletop exercise introduces a team or teams to crisis management concepts in a learning environment using a discussion based approach.  A realistic scenario facilitates the discussion. No activity occurs outside the meeting room.  No phone calls are made or received, no press briefings are held, and no action is actually taken.
<p>Initially, tabletops should be done with individual teams. First, the corporate team is challenged with a significant crisis scenario. Each team member will realize what resources and actions would be required to mount an effective response within his or her discipline. Next, supporting teams, the communications team or the legal team, run tabletops using the same scenario. Once these teams have conducted individual crisis exercises, a full-scale corporate tabletop exercise is conducted, where the concepts of integration between the teams are learned and experienced.  The exercise will test integration of leadership, communications, organizational structure, roles and responsibilities.
<p>To conduct a tabletop exercise, the leader begins by presenting each "player" with a scenario to read and make any personal notes or observations.  The exercise leader then takes the teams on a "walk through" of their initial response activities. Discussions about how to respond will naturally occur and help balance roles, responsibilities and expectations as well as reveal the type of resources required. The process is repeated, using a later point in the time to address issues that occur after the initial event.
<p>An evaluation report is created and distributed which outlines the strengths and improvement areas in the plans and makes recommendations. These are moderately complex exercises to design and conduct and should be done on an annual basis.
<p><b>The Simulation</b>
<p>The objectives of this type of exercise are to:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Improve the team's ability to handle a real business unit or corporate crisis.</li>
<p><li>Validate the team plan under simulated real-time, dynamic crisis conditions.</li>
<p><li>Identify strengths and weaknesses in the plan and the team members in an "under tension" situation.</li>
<p><li>Allow the team members to experience the emotional and resource issues of a crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simulation involves two groups - the "players," who are crisis team members responding to the incident scenario, and the "simulators," who are "producing" the incident, controlling the drill and observing and evaluating the response. The drill moves in real time as simulators place information via phone, fax, and in person into the players' rooms.  The information revealed to the players about the scenario is dynamic; changing based on the decisions and actions of the players.
<p>The simulation team acts as the entire universe outside the players' room; thus while responding to the "incident," the players always contact a member of the simulation team.  That is, if they want to contact the president, site, their family, technical resources or other members of the business, they call specific phone numbers to reach the simulators who play those roles.  Simulators also play the roles of the media, public, regulators, customers, competitors, government officials, activists, emergency responders and so on. At the end of the drill, a complete debriefing is conducted including the players, simulators, and evaluators.
<p>As with tabletop exercises, simulations should be progressively inclusive, starting with individual teams and broadening scope to multi-team then company wide exercises, with progressively less of the corporate response simulated. These exercises are very complex to design and conduct.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>Exercising is the final, but most important step in developing quality crisis management capabilities. Since exercise design, conduct and evaluation is a specialized profession, most companies do not have the in-house expertise to execute quality exercises. Perhaps that is why companies often do not follow through with this aspect of crisis preparedness. But this is penny-wise and pound-foolish to use a clich&eacute;. Looking at it another way, it's like having a life insurance policy without a beneficiary -- someone else will decide what happens to your investment.

<p><b><i>Q: </i></b>I'm with a government organization and so much of what you publish here seems to be corporate-oriented, I have a hard time relating and hesitate to share your articles with my peers and superiors because they'd say the information didn't apply to us. Could you write more about government-sector crisis management?
<p><b><i>CM: </i></b>Phil Cogan and I try very hard to use the word "organization" versus "company" in our original articles because so much of the theory and practice we espouse applies equally to both the public and private sector. Most of Phil's professional life, as many of you know, was in the government (primarily FEMA). We have certainly had articles that came directly from government public affairs -- and will soon have an excellent article written jointly by a military public affairs officer, a PR agency pro, and a corporate v.p.  If you look for the similarities, versus the differences, I suspect that you'll find applicable lessons in most of our material.
