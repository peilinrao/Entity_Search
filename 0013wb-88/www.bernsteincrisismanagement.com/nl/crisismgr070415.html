<p><b>Violence In The Workplace</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>I track crises in the news and have saved four different examples of workplace violence, usually ending in death(s), over the past month.  And that's just in the United States.  Yet so many organizations act as if it can't happen to them.
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Do you ever have employees who get angry to what appears to be near-violent levels?</li>
<p><li>Do you ever have employees get very emotionally distressed over being fired?</li>
<p><li>Do you ever have employees with strenuous domestic disputes?</li>
<p><li>Does the nature of your business attract potentially unstable people?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hello!  Workplace violence could happen to you!  Those certainly aren't the only contributing factors, but they seem to be common threads in the stories I've read over the years.  
<p>What can you do about it?  If you're the boss, call a staff meeting ASAP.  If you're not the boss, take this article to your boss and suggest he/she call a staff meeting.  At the meeting, read the article.  Then have a brainstorming session, asking questions such as:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>What do we do to stay aware of and possible provide assistance to employees who may be under tremendous stress?</li>
<p><li>What would be the best way to protect personnel here if someone started shooting?</li>
<p><li>What would we say or do in the aftermath of violence?</li>
<p><li>Might it be helpful to have local experts on this topic come in and talk about how to prevent and respond to workplace violence?</li>
</ul>
<p>(P.S. The answer to the last one is YES)

<p><b>Oh Crikey - Virginia Tech Shooting Incident Happening Now</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>Just as I finished writing the article above, I did one of my periodic CNN.com checks and found the story about the unfolding tragedy at Virginia Tech University where - if you are outside of the U.S. and haven't seen the story - 21 people are reported killed by a gunman who is still loose on campus.
<p>From the speed with which the university responded to lock down the campus, stay in touch with students by email, post statements on their website and make appropriate statements to the press, I am making an educated guess that Virginia Tech's leadership has already, wisely, engaged in crisis planning and training.
<p>In next 24-48 hours, school and police officials will be faced with:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Addressing the physical, emotional and other needs of victims and their loved ones</li>
<p><li>Addressing the needs of a shocked and mourning student body and faculty </li>
<p><li>Answering questions about how the incident occurred and if it could have been prevented or damage reduced</li>
<p><li>Conducting in-person meetings with as many stakeholders as possible</li>
<p><li>Using Internet-centered technology (if they're wise) to communicate with all their audiences in print and video formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>At best, it's a heart-wrenching and difficult task facing Virginia Tech's crisis management team.  I'm sure they, victims and everyone impacted can use our prayers right about now.

<p><i><b>Editor's Note</b>: Right way/wrong way examples are always particularly useful to me, and thus I very much appreciated receiving this succinct article by reader Karl Robe.  I usually present prospective or new clients with a list of potential crises much like the one Karl recommends.  I call it my "oh sh**" list because that's often the reaction it elicits!</i>
<p><b>When Crisis Hits, Think Like KPMG, Not Arthur Andersen</b><br><i>By Karl Robe</i></p>
<p>KPMG’s near-fatal crisis involving the sale of allegedly illegal tax shelters provides a case study in crisis management. A front-page story in the Wall Street Journal took readers inside the decision-making process as executives determined the best strategy for averting criminal indictment. Indictment &#151; not conviction mind you &#151; led to the mass exodus of Arthur Andersen clients as well as partners, and, ultimately, the accounting firm’s demise. The Journal story revealed how KPMG managed to keep its partners, clients, and, at the time of this entry, its doors open. (Client civil litigation looms.)  
<p>Unlike Andersen, KPMG executives &#151; including a former federal judge &#151; opted for a fall-on-the-sword strategy in front of the Justice Department. This strategy does have potential pitfalls, which also were described in the Journal story. 
<p>Most executives, I believe, think of the potential for a crisis as a low-probability, high-impact event. In fact, if executives take five minutes to list potential vulnerabilities that could sink their company, I believe the list would lead them to a different conclusion. The probability of crisis in any business is high. The probability of survival is low without being prepared and understanding how to deal with the different stakeholders during a crisis. A few points to consider &#151; with your attorneys and public relations counsel present &#151; if faced with a crisis:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Dump the bad news: tell it all at once. </li>
<p><li>Admit wrongdoing and apologize.</li>
<p><li>Fix the wrong.</li>
<p><li>Communicate plans to avoid it happening again.</li>
<p><li>Execute on those plans.</li>
<p><li>Provide stakeholders with progress reports along the way. </li>
</ul>
