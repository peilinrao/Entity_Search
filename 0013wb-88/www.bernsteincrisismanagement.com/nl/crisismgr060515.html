<p>Others' hindsight COULD become your foresight. That's the very essence of crisis preparedness.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="cmu"></a>CRISIS MANAGER UNIVERSITY</h2>
<p><b>What Good Is A Plan No One Knows About?</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar.  A mayor, city manager or other official responsible for implementing a disaster response plan (a) does have such a plan; (b) does implement the plan following a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or major flood; and (c) gets crucified by his/her constituency for following that plan - to the letter.
<p>The classic and all-too-common mistake on the part of the governmental official is that MOST of the people who will be impacted by the plan HAVE NO ADVANCE IDEA of how it will affect them.  They don't know they're likely to be denied access to their homes until a certain degree of safety can be assured, until basic infrastructure services can be provided, etc.  They don't know that city services will be assigned on a priority basis - and that your average homeowner isn't a priority in most cases.
<p>It's all about expectations.  I've heard it said that "expectations are often pre-meditated resentments."  Most who are not familiar with disaster response, either professionally or through the school of hard knocks, have default expectations far more optimistic than reality will grant them.  It's the task of the plan creators and disaster response team leaders to EDUCATE the populace BEFORE a disaster occurs.  Tell them what to expect. Remind them of it regularly.  Inform them what they can do to mitigate personal loss and damage.  And when disaster strikes, make sure you let them know, step by step, what's being done to roll out the plan and what that will mean to them.No one's going to be thrilled about having to endure the hardship, but they are far less likely to shoot the messenger and far more likely to be compliant with direction.
<p>This fatal flaw in most disaster planning often extends to other forms of crisis planning.  Organizations fail to consider everyone - internally or externally - who will be impacted by certain types of crises.  EVERY employee is a crisis manager for an organization, whether you want them to be or not.  Does every employee know what his or her job is when certain types of crises occur?  The job may simply be to refer inquiries to a member of the Crisis Communications Team, but the job might also mean getting physically involved with inspecting damaged buildings or calling employees who were home when the tornado hit.  It is not uncommon, unfortunately, for the senior-level members of the Crisis Communications Team or Emergency Response Team (the operational side of things) to be the only ones who know what everyone is expected to do - and then they have to try to find them and ask them to help, while in the midst of a crisis.
<p>Crisis simulations can reduce this risk, but even simulations - with the exception of huge undertakings - can't involve everyone who might be called on to assist in crisis response.  The best-possible solution, in my opinion, is orientation and refresher training for all employees, coordinated through Human Resources and mandated by organizational leadership.  Members of the response teams, including spokespersons, require more sophisticated levels of training and practice, but no employee should be left out of this process.  And don't just rely on loyalty as motivation for all employees to learn.  They also need to understand the very bottom line impact on them of poor crisis response - i.e., jobs, bonuses and benefits can all be impacted.

<p><b>Five Easy Ways To Prevent Crises</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Implement no major operational decision without asking a PR-savvy person to help you anticipate the response from all stakeholders, internal and external.</li>
<p><li>If you dare to...sit down and think, REALLY think, about what failure to prepare for crises could mean to all the people you work with, to those your organization serves, on a very personal basis.  Then let your conscience, not merely business instinct, guide your actions.</li>
<p><li>Ensure that at least two members of your leadership team are extremely Internet-savvy.</li>
<p><li>When criticized, say - with all sincerity - "You could be right." Then smile and break off the conversation.</li>
<p><li>When finding yourself caught up in a disagreement in which you're attempting to "fix" things, ask yourself, "How important is it?"</li>

<p><b>Five Easy Ways To Cause Crises</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Underestimate the power of a single angry consumer with a computer.</li>
<p><li>Have critical policies for which personnel receive little or no training and/or refresher training.</li>
<p><li>Use lawyers as a default response to detractors.</li>
<p><li>Fail to consider and plan for the impact of losing a key contractor or vendor.</li>
<p><li>Hire senior-level executives from other organizations without conducting thorough background checks.</li>

<p><b>Ask The Crisis Manager</b></p>
<p>When I'm hired to do a speaking engagement, I often ask the organizations to let me distribute - through them - a challenge to participants to send me descriptions of actual or potential crisis situations in advance of my appearance, so that I can use them to make teaching points.  It's fun for me as a writer and speaker, and my audiences seem to find it useful and entertaining.
<p>So I'm issuing that challenge to all of you, my subscribers. Don't just read - participate in your own education!  Be part of the solution!  Email me your situations, your inquiries, and I will answer them here.  I will assume that it's OK to cite you as the source of the query unless you say you'd prefer anonymity.  You can write simply by replying to the ezine or by writing directly to <a href="mailto:&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109">&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109</a>.

<p><b>Guest Authors?</b></p>
<p>I've always welcomed guest authors, as do my readers. I'm told that my authors often receive business inquiries as a result of appearing in this publication -- and it definitely raises your Google-ability (is that a word?) because of how highly my website is ranked. Original articles, or articles which have not likely been seen by my readership, are candidates for use in both the email and archived versions of this ezine.

<p><b>What Does That Slogan Mean?</b>
<p>By popular demand, I have re-opened an online store at which I sell clothing and mugs featuring the famous "Crisis Manager University" emblem and its infamous slogan, "Quoniam Stercus Accidit". That translates to "Because Stuff Happens." Except the real word isn't "stuff." There's only a 10% markup at the store to cover my costs -- it's a turnkey operation hosted by Cafe Press. I have found the items there to be a major hit with my clients and associates and great gift for any crisis manager. My purpose is to share my sense of humor with like (sick) minds as well as to prompt some folks to ask, "Who came up with this idea?" You can visit the store at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/crisismanager" target="_blank">www.cafepress.com/crisismanager</a>.
