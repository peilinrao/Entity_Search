<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I'm not
sure when it started, but a life-lesson seems to visit me from time to time and
knock me in the head and say, &quot;do you get it now?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That life lesson can be simply put:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;there are no final answers in life, and
the learning is never finished.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So enjoy
the learning.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This life-lesson is
about giving up on getting everything right -- or maybe getting any one thing
absolutely right -- and being excited about what can be accomplished.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I don't
know when this lesson first hit me in the head.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But let me offer three very different stories, each of which illustrates
a different aspect of this lesson.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>None
of these stories is profound.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most are
easily forgettable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But each one I
remember because it taught me a lesson about getting things right -- or more
precisely about letting go of getting things right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>My earliest memory of the lesson
was probably when, as a teenager, I first heard the famous ancient Hindu
parable about the blind men and the elephant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Many of you may know the story, so I'll just summarize.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It tells of a group of blind men who are
asked to describe what an elephant looks like.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Each one touches a different part of the elephant, so the one who
touches a leg says the elephant is like a tree.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The one who touches the trunk says the elephant is like a large
snake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The one who touches the ear says
the elephant is shaped like a gigantic palm leaf but made with leather.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And so on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The lesson of the story, of course, is that even though they disagree
among each other, all are right -- but only partially right -- with what they
say.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The story also suggests that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>we</i> may be like those blind men, unable
to grasp the whole truth, though we are satisfied with our partial truths.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I heard
that story in a Sunday School class, and I recall it having a big impact on me
about religion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From that moment on, I
began to take everything I was taught with a grain of salt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also taught me something about tolerance
of other religions -- that perhaps they are just seeing a different part of the
elephant than I can see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And it taught
me some humility knowing that I am probably not seeing the whole truth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The second
story happened just a few years later when I was in college and I met, for the
first and only time, a distant cousin of mine who held a fairly high government
office in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Being a political science major in college, I
was pretty confident that I knew all that I needed to know on the topic of
politics and government, and I recall an exciting conversation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was decades ago, and there is only one
piece of that conversation I still recall, but I have thought of it often.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At one point the topic turned to a political
philosophy known as libertarianism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Libertarians, many of you know, support a philosophy of keeping
government as much as possible out of the lives of citizens.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This philosophy cuts across the political
ideologies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, libertarians
oppose gun control, but support abortion rights -- both positions derive from
the theory that it is none of the government's business whether we own guns or
what we choose to do with our bodies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Anyway, at
some point in the conversation, I made a comment that though I can't fully
subscribe to the libertarian view, I admire their consistency.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is, their view of restricting government
seems to be consistently applied to every issue that comes along.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My cousin responded with a lengthy silence,
and then he said something like this:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;You know, I'm not sure that consistency is as important as a lot
of other virtues.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It was a
simple comment made thirty years ago in a long conversation about which I
remember nothing else today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it took
me so by surprise that I never forgot it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why isn't it more important to be, say, compassionate and charitable in
our treatment of others than it is to be consistent in our ideas?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I suppose
at the time I had either not heard or not understood Emerson's famous aphorism
that &quot;a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He's a little harsh in his words, but I think
I know what he means.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since then, I've
not been afraid of a little inconsistency for fear that I might not be right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Here's one
more story of a different kind, but still addresses the lesson about the
importance of being right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some years
ago I was visiting a man in the hospital.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He had a rare intestinal disease in which he couldn't digest
liquids.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So he was in the hospital
indefinitely until they could figure out what to do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had already been there quite a while, with
no end in sight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In talking
with him, he made a comment I will never forget.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said something like this:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You know, I always avoided visiting
people in the hospital.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasn't
because hospitals bother me; it was because I never felt I could come up with
the right things to say to them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
scared me that I would say the wrong things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But now, since I've been in the hospital, I've changed my thinking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now I know it doesn't matter at all what
people say when they visit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only
thing that matters is that they are there.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>These very
different stories share a common insight for me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In each case, they served to make me question
how important it is to get things right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In each case we discover that there are, in fact, things more important
than being right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I also want
to say some more about this idea of &quot;getting things right.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In using that phrase, I hope you don't think
I'm talking simply about what we mean when we say someone is a
&quot;perfectionist.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is not
what I mean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A &quot;perfectionist&quot;
is a person who always has to make sure every &quot;i&quot; is dotted and every
&quot;t&quot; is crossed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
perfectionist cannot abide sloppy work, and that is sometimes good.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that is not what I mean by &quot;getting
things right.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What I mean
by &quot;getting things right&quot; is the need we humans seem to have to know
what the truth is about life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to
know for sure which choices are right when we decide on a job or a spouse or a
house to buy or a church to attend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
want to know that our choices are the right choices.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We want to know whether it is right
to be a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to know for certain if there is or is
not a God, whether there is or is not an afterlife.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don't want mere speculation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to be right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to know the right way to raise a
child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to be certain about
whether the death penalty is the right policy or the wrong one for our society.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to know if Jesus really did rise from
the dead or if human beings have souls.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We want to know whether it was right to invade <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
whether privatization will save or harm the Social Security system.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>On any question of any weighty nature, we
just want to be right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When it comes to
the big questions of life, we don't want to get it wrong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want assurance that we are right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or at least we want to avoid being
wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I find this
a fairly common feeling among us mortals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And as a mortal myself, I share in that aspiration for being right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, I may experience that wish to be
right more than most people, and that is why it is important for me to keep
receiving lessons from life about why being right isn't always the most
important part of life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Life is
about living, and sometimes insisting on being right seems to get in the way of
life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Some years
ago, I was delighted to discover that there is, in fact, a distinct
philosophical tradition that is rooted in this notion that we can't always
expect to get things right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
philosophy has been given the name of &quot;pragmatism.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Interestingly, it is one of the very few
distinctively American traditions, and its originated from the work of the
early twentieth century thinkers John Dewey and William James.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The word
&quot;pragmatism&quot; has become cloaked with some rather superficial
meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For most of us the word simply
means finding the simplest way to solve a problem.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Someone who is &quot;pragmatic&quot; finds an
efficient solution without becoming bogged down in subtle nuances of argument
or meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To
illustrate the commonly accepted understanding of &quot;pragmatism,&quot; I'm
going to risk telling a joke I told a few years ago.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I re-tell it because first, it is
appropriate, second, there may be quite a few people here today who weren't
here a few years ago when I told it before, and third, it is one of the few
jokes I've told from the pulpit that people actually thought was funny:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>During
the French Revolution, three people were scheduled to be executed one day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One was French, but the second was English
and the third was an American.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Frenchman went first, placing
his neck on the slot below the guillotine blade.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The executioner asked if he had any last
words, and the French prisoner yelled out, </i>Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité!<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
executioner released the blade, but as it descended it started slowing down
with a squealing sound until it actually stopped an inch above his neck.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those in attendance realized it was a sign
that he should be freed, so the Executioner unbound him and let him go.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The second prisoner was English and
when asked if he had any last words, he exclaimed,</i> God save the King! <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>whereupon he placed his neck below the blade
and the executioner again released it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As before, the blade mysteriously started slowing down until it grounded
to a stop above the Englishmans head.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was another miracle!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Englishman was released.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Then the American prisoner was
escorted to the guillotine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He too was
asked whether he had any last words.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After thinking about it for a little while, he finally said to the
executioner, </i>You know, if you put a little oil on that thing, it might
work better.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That
illustrates, I think, our commonly understood meaning of someone who is a pragmatist.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By and large we say a pragmatist is an
efficient problem solver.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That is not
what James and Dewey meant by the term, nor those who follow in their
tradition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Pragmatism
begins with the conviction that truth is ultimately illusive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No matter how deeply we ponder the important
questions of life, we cannot ultimately be certain of the answer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of John Dewey's books was titled <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;The Quest for Certainty,&quot;</i> and
his conclusion was that over centuries of human attempts to grasp truth with
certainty, we have been unable to succeed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Contemporary science has served to confirm this premise.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Philosophers of science point out that there
is no scientific proposition that can be 100% certain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All is theory.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some theories work extraordinarily well when implemented,
and some work less well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But no theory
rises to the level of certainty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So if we
begin with the acknowledgement that we can never know truth with certainty,
what criteria do we use to make choices?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The answer is surprisingly simple, almost deceptively simple.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We look not so much for what is true, but
more to the point, we look for what works.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And what do we mean by &quot;what works?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It means we look for what provides for the
outcome or consequence that we wish for.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This, after
all, is also the method science uses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Experiments are designed to demonstrate whether a theory works.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a theory doesn't work under such
conditions, it is either discarded or revised.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The pragmatist says personal beliefs are likewise measured by what
difference those beliefs make in a person's life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question of &quot;truth&quot; is
by-passed, and we look, more importantly, to the consequences of that<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>belief.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>By the way,
this is the reason our ill-fated American friend at the guillotine was not a
true pragmatist, in the sense I'm suggesting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It seems he failed fully to examine the consequences of his choices and
let those consequences guide his decision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>William James in particular worked
carefully on this idea of evaluating beliefs according to consequences rather
than truth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A belief has merit, he said,
according to the practical differences that belief makes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Take, for example, a belief in God.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The truth of that proposition will never be
known.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What can be known is whether such
a belief makes a difference in a person's life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If believing in a God or not believing in a God makes a person more
responsible and compassionate, that belief has a very practical meaning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a person's belief about God makes no
difference in how they live, their belief has no practical meaning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What a person believes to be true has little
importance; the consequences of those beleifs can have substantial
importance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
insight can be applied to my opening stories.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Remember the man who was afraid to visit people in the hospital because
he feared he couldn't find the right thing to say to the patient?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we concede the fact that there is no such
thing as &quot;the right thing&quot; and understand that what is
&quot;right&quot; is what results in the best outcome, then we discover, as he
did, that showing concern is more important than finding the right words.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Or revisit
my cousin's critique of consistency, saying that being consistent may not
necessarily be the greatest virtue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
was critiquing the libertarian political philosophy that consistently applies
to every political issue the principle of least government interference.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Its philosophy is much like the famous adage
of Jefferson that &quot;that government which governs best, governs
least.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I continue
to hold deep respect for the libertarians I know, yet I take a pragmatist view
about consistency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To apply the
principle of the least government intrusion without evaluating the consequences
of such policies in each case seems to me to make the virtue of
&quot;consistency of principle&quot; more important than other values -- such
as justice or equity or human welfare.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The pragmatist approach suggests that since we cannot be certain about <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> transcendent principle, our
responsibility is to look at what works best according to the consequences we
seek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And then
there's the parable of the blind men and the elephant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The parable reminds us that our vision of the
truth is limited.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it also teaches us
that we can benefit from learning the perspectives of others who see the world
differently.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The consequence of
believing that our own view of the elephant is the true view is that we miss
the insights from other views.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
consequence of being skeptical about the ultimate truth of our view is that we
welcome and benefit from the insights of others.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When we
forego the need to get things right, in fact, we open ourselves up to greater
personal growth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And that growth comes
from mutual learning from others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Perhaps the
most prominent philosophical voice today in defense of the pragmatic approach is
Stanford philosopher Richard Rorty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Rorty affirms the pragmatic traditional dismissal of the quest to find
certain truth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In its place, though, he
offers a different recipe for life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
calls it &quot;conversation&quot; -- the give and take of ideas, the incremental
learning of communities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Life, he says,
is or ought to be an ongoing conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This does not mean just verbal communication.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is becoming engaged with others in such a
way that your life becomes shaped by those encounters.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Life is
about learning, about improving, but not about getting it finally right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Life is an ongoing process of discovery, and
this happens through constructive relationships with others.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Conversation is all those blind men listening
to each other as they describe their perspectives.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are in conversation whenever we allow
ourselves to be challenged and re-awakened by our encounters with others.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We do not
carry on that conversation in order to discover some truth and thereby end the
conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rather, the conversation
is the end in itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The consequence of
conversation is continually adapting in new ways to the world that is always
changing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Out of
several books by Rorty, there is one sentence that absolutely stung me, turned
on a light, and stayed with me now for years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This sentence provided another of those life-lesson stories like the
stories I told earlier.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is a fairly
simple sentence:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;In the end, the pragmatist
tells us, what matters is our loyalty to other human beings clinging together
against the dark, not our hope in getting things right.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
sentence may not startle you as it did, and still does, for me, but in that
sentence I picture a Door Number One and a Door Number Two.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Door Number One has a sign that says
&quot;Helping each other successfully get through the hard times of
life.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Door Number Two has a sign
that says, &quot;Being Right.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Which door would you choose?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
probably would not hesitate to pick the first one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Getting
things right or getting successfully and happily through life?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be good to be given such a choice,
but we aren't.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The choice of getting
things right is, for us mere mortals, an unachievable goal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I confess
I'm still working on this life lesson, and I haven't quite got it completely
mastered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I still feel this urge to be
certain I'm right on things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
appreciate whenever I stumble over something that knocks the lesson into my
brain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The message
of pragmatism is that &quot;getting things right&quot; is a futile and
misguided goal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One lesson from that
message is that of continuous change and growth and transformation in
life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we stay in conversation with
others, our life changes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We learn and
never stop learning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We change and never
stop changing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is as if we continue
becoming a new person as life draws us into a new chapter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We learn and grow and change with life, never
fully completing it, but seeking something better, leaving our past to a better
future as we grow and change.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>
