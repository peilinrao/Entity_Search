<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Since her death on October 24<sup>th</sup>,
many of us have re-visited the story of Rosa Parks and the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Montgomery</st1:place></st1:City> bus boycott of 1955.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we read deeply enough, we know that the
story is far more complex than the simple legend that has been taught.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is something of a cultural myth that
has arisen around her legendary act and her legendary life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The myth is somewhat different than the real
story itself, but in many ways, there is far more truth to the myth than there
is to the actual story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let me explain
that convoluted sentence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The myth goes something like
this:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rosa Parks was a 43 year old
ordinary Black woman in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Montgomery</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Alabama</st1:State></st1:place> in 1955 – a housewife, a seamstress,
and a tailor’s assistant at a downtown department store.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On December 1<sup>st</sup>, she boarded a
city bus after a tiring day at work, and sat down to rest her feet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the white section at the front of the
bus filled up, the driver demanded that she move to the back section,
designated the “colored” section, to give a white man a seat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She refused.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was a spontaneous decision on her part, but she was tired – not only tired
after a long day of work, but also tired of being treated as a second-class
citizen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The driver had her arrested,
and in response the black community of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montgomery</st1:place></st1:City>
began a bus boycott, led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The peaceful protest worked, bringing the
segregated bus company to its knees, and resulting in the Supreme Court’s
rejection of those segregation laws in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alabama</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That is the myth of Rosa Parks, and
it is entirely true, as far as it goes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But there is more to it than can be gleaned from the mere myth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For one thing, Rosa Parks was more than a
simple day laborer wanting a seat after an exhausting day at work.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was in her quiet way a civil rights
activist long before that pivotal day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She had been a long-time secretary of the local chapter of the NAACP,
and was well known in civil rights circles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She had attended civil rights training classes at the <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Highlander</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Folk</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Tennessee</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And furthermore, she was well aware of a long-standing movement among
civil rights leaders in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montgomery</st1:place></st1:City>
to challenge the segregationist laws on the buses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The public humiliation of African
Americans on the buses in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Montgomery</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Alabama</st1:State></st1:place> was a long time sore
point for the Black community.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some
years before, she herself had been thrown off a bus because she refused to
enter the back door instead of the front door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As early as 1946, the leaders of the
African American community were organizing to end segregation on buses, and as
early as 1953, Black leaders in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montgomery</st1:place></st1:City>
were threatening the city with a bus boycott.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Almost three out of four bus riders in town were black citizens, so a
boycott would surely bankrupt the bus company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>By the time Rosa Parks was arrested, the plan for a boycott had been
well on its way, and she was aware of the plan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>While several other black women had been arrested earlier that year for
refusing to move to back of the bus, the leaders of the movement weren’t
confident that their circumstances were the right ones to build their case
around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One person arrested had been a
15 year old black girl that <st1:place w:st="on">Rosa</st1:place> had known
from an NAACP youth group she led.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It is true that Rosa Parks was not
“chosen” to be arrested as their test case, and it is true that her refusal to
move to the back was not a premeditated plan she intended to happen that day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it is also the case that when the day
came – when she finally said, “enough is enough” and realized she couldn’t
continue to bow to the humiliating dictates of an oppressive system – on the
day that she firmly refused to move from her seat, she was by then well aware
and well informed that the civil rights leaders in the city were looking for an
opportunity for public protest of the segregationist system on the buses, and
had discussed the prospect of a boycott as a part of that protest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes she was tired, and yes she was quiet and
unassuming in her demeanor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But she was
not naïve.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She knew exactly what she was
doing, what the consequences would likely be, and why it was important.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I said earlier that the myth that
surrounds the legend of Rosa Parks is somewhat different than the real story,
but I also said that in many ways there is far more truth to the myth than
there is to the actual story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The legend is about an individual who was fed
up with the indignity of the segregationist laws, and though that isn’t the
only truth to the story, it is perhaps the most important one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The true legacy of Rosa Parks’ courageous
action is how injustice against one person showed the world the injustice of
the entire segregationist system.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
actual facts concerning her long-term active involvement in the larger civil
rights movement do not detract from the truth of the myth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rosa Parks’ courage came not just from her
personal sense of being mistreated; it also came from a deeper sense of justice
for all, learned by years of living in an unjust society.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Many Americans today recognize a
certain irony in the honoring of Rosa Parks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>From the early 21<sup>st</sup> century it is so easy for society at
large to recognize the courage of her decision that day; the dehumanizing and
unjust the segregationist practices of that time are so obvious to us now.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it wasn’t obvious back then to most of
white middle-class <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those views that come easily today were not
so easy in the mid-twentieth century.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
the time of the civil rights movement, it was a struggle to get most Americans
to comprehend the nature of the injustice of segregation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Even among the white Americans who believed such laws to be wrong,
there were many, even most, and even in the North, who were uneasy with the
outspokenness of civil rights activists, and would rather just look the other
way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were many who sympathized
with the sense of injustice, but would rather they not be so vocal and
confrontational about it all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were
many, maybe even most, who didn’t like the idea of people breaking unjust laws
in order to change them, and somehow felt that the threat to the order of
society was more of a danger than the threat of unjust laws to the humanity of
the minorities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>It is difficult to perceive from our day why Martin Luther King was so
unpopular in his time, even among the moderate middle classes which believed
racist laws to be unjust.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>King himself
was puzzled by the apathy of the moderate middle-class whites.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From his cell in a jail in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Birmingham</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Alabama</st1:State></st1:place>,
King wrote about his disappointment in the resolve of so many well-meaning
people in the white community.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here is
