                    <div class="entry-content"><p>June 28, Oregon State University engineers have found a way first: the successful use of inkjet printing technology to produce a CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) thin-film solar batteries, a new method to reduce raw material waste by 90% and through the use of the rich potential of compounds, significantly reduces the manufacturing costs of solar batteries. Experts said that with the technology, scientists can ultimately produce excellent performance, can be rapid manufacturing, low cost thin-film solar electronics.</p>
<p>The study published in the professional journal &#8220;Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells&#8221;, the scientists have also applied for a patent for this technology. Although developed the solar battery conversion rate of 5%, of taking a step forward needs to be improved, but scientists believe the research will eventually lead to a new generation of solar technology.</p>
<p>The latest study, scientists create an ink jet method to use, can chalcopyrite printed on the base, about 5% energy conversion efficiency. Scientists say that in theory, they can get 12% conversion efficiency, so you can create a commercial production of solar cells.</p>
<p>Scientists also and Greg Herman, associate professor of Chemical Engineering school to study other inkjet technology can be applied to the compounds, the cost even lower.</p>
<p>Many ways to make solar cells are either very time-consuming or require expensive vacuum equipment or toxic compounds. Oregon State University scientists are working to eliminate these obstacles and developed a cheaper, more environmentally friendly solar technology. They said that the latest technology may be hatching a lot of new businesses, providing a large number of jobs. If you can continue to lower manufacturing costs, other barriers were 11 break, one day, it can even be directly integrated into the manufacturing of roofing materials in solar cells, solar cells so that the real &#8220;flying into the homes of ordinary people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihong, concluded: &#8220;Overall, we have developed a simple, quick, direct, solution-based deposition process to manufacture high-quality CIGS solar cell approach, by controlling the low-cost metal salt precursor compound at the molecular level structure , can easily access to safe, simple, stable ink in the air.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>In nuclear power is people to re-examine the today, the use of solar energy has been valued, our side have all kinds of depend on solar energy of electronic products, but driven solar notebook no precedent. Let&#8217;s have a look the industrial designer Andrea Ponti bring solar battery notebook concept design picture.</p>
<p>Andrea Ponti will of the Solar energy for Solar Panel notebook named all our PC, and the design won the nomination of design contest 2011 Fujitsu, only and not too clear whether the design will be Fujitsu into physical products.</p>
<p>In the concept design, we can see stylist will put solar battery on the two place, A place behind the screen is A face also is shell, another in B above the surface below, touchpad keyboard so the approach can ensure that laptop for most of the time can accept to sunlight.</p>
<p>But in fact the solar energy notebook bigger challenges should not power supply problems in the sun but direct screen reflective problem, consider this problem is not only a enterprise, last year when the apple once registered a patent use external light screen device, like is also for the future of the similar product lay the foundation.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>June 3,he Chinese University of Hong Kong, spent more than two years, the use of less expensive than traditional crystalline silicon battery and less than half &#8220;of copper indium gallium selenide&#8221; materials, the system successfully developed a new generation of high power thin film solar battery. One is only three microns thick, palm-sized thin film solar battery for three hours in the sun as a cell phone can be fully charged.</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong media reports, the current world market of solar cells, nine as crystalline silicon cells. Department of Physics, Hong Kong, Chinese University research team led by Professor Xiao Xudong, since 2009, seized the CUHK and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government-funded 800 million, less expensive and lighter material from &#8220;CIGS&#8221; thin-film solar cell materials to study, successful developed the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency of 17% electricity rate system for the Asia-Pacific region the highest thin-film solar cells, the ratio is closer to the world&#8217;s highest rate of 20.3% of the electricity system.</p>
<p>Xiao Xudong said, using the &#8220;CIGS&#8221; thin-film solar battery materials, only three microns thick, thinner than the crystalline silicon cells 50 times. In terms of production cost, thin film crystalline silicon solar cell battery saving than half of the production costs. Xiao Xudong said that the international market is widely expected in the next 20 years, the market share of thin film solar cells from 10% to 35%.</p>
<p>As the new material is soft and thin film solar battery portable, Xiao Xudong, said thin film solar cells can be attached to any item covered in the back of the smooth or uneven, such as backpacks, handbags, tents, umbrellas and other personal items, anytime, anywhere electronic charge. &#8220;If mobile phones attached to the back, the sun and a full three hours is sufficient electrical capacity to 500 mA for the general mobile phone or digital camera.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xiao Xudong, said companies are already interested in this technique revealed an estimated one and a half after the fastest growing energy market.</p>
