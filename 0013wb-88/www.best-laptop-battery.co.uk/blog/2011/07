                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Integrated building and solar technology will always inspire creativity. Intersolar North America show a novel design eye-catching: The honeycomb structure of the solar battery panels to replace the building exterior.</p>
<p>The solar panels were shaped as it is called beehive photovoltaic (BeeHivePV), from Israel to a new company SolarOr. Just completed the design SolarOr, to attract investors and partners to market and carry out demonstration projects.</p>
<p>Chief Operating Officer AviSasi booth at Intersolar told reporters, beehive PV is SolarOr the first product; The company was founded in December 2007, hoping to raise 500 million dollars.</p>
<p>Sasi showed reporters the panels of the sample, it is composed by a double glazing clip, looks like a honeycomb cross-section. The honeycomb is made from the PMMA, the peak of each hexagonal room is equipped with a silicon cell. Sasi said the hexagonal design of the sun gathered just ordinary light 2.5 times.</p>
<p>Assuming the conversion rate of 14% of the battery, then a square meter of solar panels can generate 140 watts power. Building integrated solar technology and the charm is that it not only heat, but also to generate clean energy.</p>
<p>However, the current design can not be applied immediately. The reason is that the architect has been used in the construction of solar equipment for the shape is very harsh. Ordinary commercial building glass wall gives a sense of fresh, usually these are colored glass, because it can reduce the number of light and heat. These colors also allow designers more creative space.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>HP Tablet TouchPad While in some respects better than the iPad, but there are some critical flaws in, so still not enough to pose a threat to the iPad.</p>
<p>Although there are some very good features, but some of the basic functions in the TouchPad is still lacking. The Tablet PC uses Qualcomm processor, but performance is not strong. When you switch from portrait to landscape view, you need to take some time to calibrate, even with a simultaneous presentation of the case of vertical and horizontal screen.</p>
<p>Battery life is also far from satisfactory. Although HP said, this product of video playback or surfing time can reach 8-9 hours, but my stress test, only life 4.5 hours. I have been in the testing process to the maximum brightness of video, and started the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. And even if the maximum brightness, the screen is still more than iPad 2 Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and becomes dark, the latter using the Google Android operating system. TouchPad also a lack of rear camera, but this Tablet PC has become the standard configuration, but is useful for shooting video. Polished black plastic case is also very easy to leave fingerprints.</p>
<p>Before the acquisition by HP, Palm&#8217;s challenge is not attracting enough users, thereby allowing the developers profit. This issue may also continue to plague the TouchPad. Apple claims, iPad specific applications has more than 90,000 models, and HP TouchPad application currently only 300 models, plus a 1000 number for the phone to prepare and carry out a certain amount for the Tablet PC to adjust the application.</p>
<p>In order to attract developers, HP will not only launch the App Store, will develop a product called Pivot, which is a fine appearance, resembles the magazine&#8217;s online catalog. HP says will eventually be extended to more devices WebOS, including printers and computers running Microsoft Windows systems, we hope to attract a large number of users, and enhance the competitiveness of the ecosystem. This strategy is very ambitious, but not necessarily be successful. Especially considering the TouchPad hardware defects, and perhaps better to wait TouchPad 2 release.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>What is the lithium-ion battery?</p>
<p>Lithium-ion battery (LithiumIonBattery, abbreviated as LIB), also known as lithium batteries. Into liquid lithium ion battery (LIB) and lithium-ion polymer battery (PLB) 2 class. Among them, the liquid lithium-ion battery is the Li + intercalation compound as the positive and negative secondary battery. LiCoO2 cathode using lithium compounds or LiMn2O4, negative use of lithium &#8211; carbon intercalation compounds.</p>
<p>Lithium battery for all commercial use is by far the secondary chemical power in the most excellent battery performance, which is to promote the lithium battery for electric bikes is a key factor.</p>
<p>1,higher than the energy</p>
<p>    Whether it is smaller than the energy or the energy to weight ratio, lithium batteries for more than three times higher than lead-acid batteries. Which determines the battery smaller and lighter, its market consumer feel good.</p>
<p>2,Long cycle life</p>
<p>    Lithium batteries for electric bikes cycle life is generally more than 800 times, the use of lithium iron phosphate cathode material of lithium batteries can reach about 2000 times, 1.5 times than lead-acid batteries to more than 5 times. This greatly reduces the cost of lithium batteries used to improve the ease of consumer use.</p>
<p>3,has a wide range of charging power</p>
<p>    This is the lithium battery has a unique advantage. When needed, can control the charging time 20 ~ 60min, the charging efficiency of 85% or more. Further technological innovation, based on the characteristics of better play, can have good commercial value.</p>
<p>4, rate discharge performance</p>
<p>    Lithium battery discharge rate can reach more than 10 magnification, special production can reach 30 magnification. This feature is very beneficial to ride electric bikes intelligent control technology. This feature not only present a very good development and utilization.</p>
<p>    China world&#8217;s first lithium-ion battery production, the world&#8217;s total production accounted for over 1 / 3, more than 100 manufacturers of lithium ion battery materials demand, many manufacturers have planned over the next two years to yield a substantial increase. At present, China&#8217;s lithium battery manufacturer BYD liquid form led to TCL lithium polymer battery, led by two giants. TCL completed a polymer lithium-ion battery batteries from R &amp; D to mass production of the whole process, and quickly come to the forefront of this technology. TCL production of polymer lithium batteries in the battery electrochemical impedance, energy density, high temperature discharge, etc. are among the ranks of world-class, BYD is the boss of liquid lithium-ion battery, while TCL is a new generation of lithium-ion polymer battery The boss, lithium polymer has an advantage over liquid lithium.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>U.S. research firm Solarbuzz regions has make a prediction of the import volume and the proportion of solar battery in 2015. Import ratio in the world in 2010 accounted for 81% of Europe, 2015 to 53 per cent, while Japan and China, the top five countries in the Asia-Pacific region will increase from 11% to 26%. U.S. market from 5% to 14%.</p>
<p> European import ratio will reduce the symptoms have been present. In 2011, the import ratio in all regions, Europe is expected to decline to 65%. Europe&#8217;s leading solar cell into countries such as Germany and Italy, by January 2010 to July 2011 before the Feed-in Tariff reduction in the acquisition of the largest proportion of 1 / 3 effects. Allegedly, the German demand for the first quarter of 2011 over the previous year dropped to half.</p>
<p>In Asia Pacific, by 2010 China&#8217;s demand increased rapidly, more than double last year, the Asia-Pacific region after Japan&#8217;s second largest importing region. Point of view from different provinces, Jiangsu and other provinces need more strong, demand for public purposes accounted for 49% of China&#8217;s total.</p>
