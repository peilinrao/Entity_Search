                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Chinese solar companies, including JA Solar Holdings Co., Ltd., Suntech Power Holdings Co., Ltd. and LDK Solar LDK Solar Co., Ltd. recorded in the third quarter loss, due to declining sales and rising inventories. Low-cost solar panels in China, supply surge, as well as changes in some of Europe&#8217;s major markets in the context of solar energy subsidies, the cost of solar energy companies race to the bottom, and even lead to competition with Chinese manufacturers who hurt themselves. JA Solar Tuesday&#8217;s results show that second-quarter net loss of 376 million yuan.</p>
<p>Although the results were published there was a brief short-covering rally, after all, is a catastrophic solar sector investment, because the Chinese long-term overcapacity and cut subsidies in Europe, the price of solar modules in a year dropped by 40%. Manufacturers plan to increase 50% next year solar cell production capacity and demand forecast is only half that level, which means that the price of solar cells will continue to face pressure, despite the growing number of European and U.S. companies have been squeezed out of the the industry. However, the good news is, with the excess capacity of photovoltaic solar power to change the commercial development of economics, making it a public utility, few large-scale solar power array in the case of subsidies can also be self-development.</p>

<p>Organic bulk heterojunction solar batteris made ​​from organic semiconductor compounds, can convert sunlight into electricity. Through the process of printing and other programs to address the possibility of storage of organic semiconductors, these materials have the potential to be applied to flexible large-area photovoltaic devices mass production. Today, the most efficient organic bulk heterojunction solar batteris are made ​​from semiconductor polymers. The reasons for the synthesis process, and small molecule solar batteris, semiconductor mass production of polymer structure and device performance will be on an even greater difference between the bulk.</p>
<p>Through careful design, Guillermo Bazan and colleagues developed a highly efficient heterojunction can be used for solar battery mass production of small molecule semiconductors, the performance of these devices is close to the best polymer solar batteries.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>According to foreign media reports, the Apple iOS 5 operating system vulnerabilities that exist in excessive power consumption, will soon release a new version once again to resolve this issue, expected to launch next week iOS 5.0.2 to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Apple launched the iOS 5.0 operating system, there is a lot of users there the problem of excessive battery drain, Apple has also publicly admitted that the system vulnerability to cause this problem, and soon after launched iOS 5.0.1 version in order to improve excessive battery consumption vulnerability. But after installing the new version, many users too fast battery drain phenomenon is still not improved.</p>
<p>According to German website Macerkopf, Apple battery power too quickly to address the loopholes, will soon release an updated version of iOS 5.0.2 to address this issue, expected time of the weekend will be released next week.</p>
<p>Analysts said that Apple released a new version faster than everyone expected, when the release of iOS 5.0.1 only took two weeks, significantly below expectations. The updated version of iOS 5.0.2 speed is amazing. Hope that this updated version of Apple&#8217;s battery power too quickly to solve the problem, or even another fast update rate are difficult to obtain consumer acceptance, but that is just Apple&#8217;s way to appease consumers.</p>
<p>German site Macerkopf the report also said that Apple&#8217;s vulnerability after the repair the battery will soon release iOS 5.1 version. In the new version of iOS 5.1 will greatly enhance the Siri Voice Assistant, users can control by voice command Siri completed iOS device camera, shooting video of the operation, Siri can also be turned on or off WiFi and Bluetooth. The new features will not make excessive consumption of electricity Siri, Siri make more intelligent and convenient.</p>
<p>Industry sources, Siri voice assistant attracted the attention of many consumers, the iPhone 4S to create a new record has a significant role. However, there has been some time ago Siri down a wide range of phenomena, Apple&#8217;s cloud services also exposed shortcomings, Apple need to strengthen the ability of cloud services, in order to face the world in the future of iPhone users will not use assistant Siri voice again Siri standstill, no matter how powerful Siri will be furnished.</p>

This new plant produce components up to 25 million kilowatts. Thus, the first solar company in Germany, the total capacity of nearly 500 MW. Content from Global Solar PV network news website portals.</p>
<p>After a year of construction, this total investment of more than 17 million euros of the plant production schedule. Currently, the first solar company in Germany, nearly doubled the number of workers employed, from the initial 650 to the current 1,200.</p>
<p>First Solar&#8217;s vice president of global operations, said: &#8220;We commissioned a second plant in Germany, the first solar company to become Europe&#8217;s largest and most modern manufacturer of thin-film solar cell formed our investment also shows in Germany importance of solar energy in Germany currently has become the major producer and consumer market. &#8221;</p>
<p>The new plant also highlights First Solar&#8217;s complete life cycle concept. For example, the top of the new factory buildings installed solar power systems for the plant to provide electricity, thereby reducing the company&#8217;s carbon footprint.</p>

The project is funded by anonymous foreign joint venture partners, investment and development.</p>
<p>NASENI said the plant could help reduce Nigeria&#8217;s dependence on imported solar panels, but also to promote solar street lighting, water pumping for irrigation, substations, traffic lights, and small farm machinery development. Global photovoltaic net</p>
<p>NBF Topics reported that, NASENI Olusegun Adewoye said the head of the testing phase and the plant is ready to begin operations.
