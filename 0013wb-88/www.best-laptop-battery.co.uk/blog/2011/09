                    <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;The father of China relay protection&#8221;, North China Electric Power University, School of Electrical Engineering doctoral student mentor Dr. Yang Qixun recently pointed out, if the electric car&#8217;s battery to charge, discharge at the right time, can greatly reduce costs. The other is the off-peak charging, customers can even store the electricity sold to grid. Therefore, the development of portable battery power battery research and development should be a direction.</p>
<p>Development of smart grid for many reasons, one of the reasons is that the volatility of large-scale application of renewable energy, especially large-scale wind power has brought many problems and challenges.</p>
<p>Currently, the world in the development of wind power, but China is a bit special, large-scale wind power has brought us some problems. China is a developing country, per capita electricity consumption is still very low, the grid in the rapid development of wind power development faster, but our water, wind, coal resources are concentrated in the west and north, but the largest load center in the east coast. West and north of the smaller system capacity, which makes high-capacity long-distance transmission is inevitable. China&#8217;s current power system in thermal power (70%), lack of natural gas and other easy-to-adjust power, difficult to stabilize the large-scale wind power fluctuations, so we need smart grid, adequate storage facilities and information technology support.</p>

<p>According to the Nikkei Industrial Daily News reported that two Panasonic lithium battery plant in Japan has been discontinued. The source said, Panasonic has just started operating last year in Osaka Suminoe plant expansion plans on hold.</p>
<p>Japanese politicians of Japan&#8217;s industrial &#8220;hollowing out&#8221; expressed concern. By the strong appreciation of the yen and the nuclear crisis on the long-term concerns about the impact of energy supply, Japan&#8217;s industrial &#8220;hollowing out&#8221; is gradually deepened.</p>
<p>Japanese companies have long-term occupation of lithium-ion battery manufacturing dominance, but now companies such as Samsung, the Korean manufacturers are gradually replacing their status. A survey shows that Samsung now holds the largest market share.</p>
<p>Panasonic plans by April 2015, the factory production equipment in China accounts for the special lithium battery lithium battery production ratio from the current 10% -20% to 50%. This means that Panasonic will reduce domestic production scale.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>In each big market counter, you may see like SONY X5 such transparent mobile phone, but display the battery use of or part of traditional material. And CuiYi team has just invented of lithium battery, can solve the problems. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got a battery of transparent substrate.&#8221; LiuYaLin said, our current lithium battery basic is in black or not pervious to light material, the transparent packaging of lithium battery is to make it transparent surface.</p>
<p>From the human eye resolution limit it, if less than 50 microns, materials and view it is transparent. &#8220;According to understand new transparent, lithium battery in a grid of every line width is about 35 micron, because a single line small, light will pass through the grid lines of transparent gap between, the entire mesh area looks is transparent but this transparent is relative.&#8221; Generally a battery is more than a battery layer. &#8220;If the three battery cascade together, transparency can achieve 60%, premise must also is the grid line matching accurate,&#8221; looks like home outfit screens than it slightly more transparent some. &#8221;</p>
<p>In the battery parts after realizing transparent, transparent iPhone may be realized.</p>
<p>Originally the use of copper, aluminum etc material is opaque, CuiYi they use is transparent dimethyl poss together. This substance is flexible, battery softness should good. &#8220;More importantly, new transparent li-ion batteries cost and conventional battery. LiuYaLin quite said,&#8221; now young people&#8217;s pursuit vogue and trendy, the current domestic haven&#8217;t completely transparent mobile phone, some also just conceptual machine, transparent lithium batteries for mobile phone can bring transparency and broad prospects. &#8220;</p>

The research, published in a recent issue of the nano letters,.</p>
<p>Because the battery needs to be in the cathode and anode placed very large graphite surfaces, the surface of the upstream resources with graphite surfaces and related technology enterprise, it&#8217;s definitely a good news</p>
<p>The technology will rewrite the battery industry and, by extension, the prospect of the development of the related industry will also important changes occurred, special focus on and storage of electric battery electric vehicle, the new energy equipment, etc, and if the technology allows, all the world&#8217;s energy consumption pattern will be transformed to store electricity consumption.</p>

<p>Company executive vice president of solar ChoiChang-sik, said in an interview with Reuters, Japan&#8217;s nuclear leakage of nuclear energy after the crisis all the more offensive people, oil prices continued growth and other factors will increase the demand for solar energy.</p>
<p>Choi said that as the Chinese solar cell manufacturers to significantly expand production and global demand has been weak, solar overcapacity situation will continue until 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole chain of overcapacity will continue until 2013, this process will also be accompanied by intense industry consolidation.&#8221;</p>
<p>2011 brutal market has made it the entire solar industry is injured, a lot of strength of the smaller manufacturers are in the edge of collapse or be acquired.</p>
<p>This year, major markets such as Italy and Germany moves to cut subsidies to promote solar energy solar panel prices dropped 20 percent, making the fast-growing solar energy industry to a vital turning point. U.S. solar companies constantly coming bankruptcy news highlights low-cost foreign companies and Chinese manufacturers in the competition difficulties.</p>
<p>Despite the poor market conditions, but Samsung SDI has not been much disturbed. The company plans to 2015 solar cell production capacity increased from the current 150MW to 3GW. Samsung SDI&#8217;s major competitors in the market are China&#8217;s Suntech Power (SuntechPowerHoldings) and Trina Solar (TrinaSolar).</p>
<p>In addition, Samsung SDI plans to enter thin-film solar market early next year. The market is the United States and Japan, Showa Shell FirstSolar oil (ShowaShellSekiyuKK) of the rule.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Pennsylvania State University research team is trying to develop microbial fuel battery, the battery can put raw sewage into clean water, and electricity. More attractive is the realization of desalination technology in the future may become the &#8220;threefold&#8221; technology.</p>
<p>The traditional use of hydrogen fuel battery power generation, but the team first tried to use organic-rich wastewater to generate electricity. In theory, the sewage directly into the fuel battery can generate electricity while cleaning wastewater. The battery system works is: the sewage-eating bacteria in organic matter, followed by the release of electrons, the carbon rod in the fuel battery on the concentration, in water to form the current loop. Once the discharge capacity to a certain extent, can be used.</p>
