                    <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Usually the message too much, too old for batteries for mobile phones.&#8221; Completed just before the holiday of Spring Festival, many users sent a such a complaint. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1300.htm">inspiron 1300 battery</a> , With the constant improvement of mobile phone applications, users of mobile phones and other performance standby, set higher requirements.</p>
<p>The price of continued weakness in the mobile phone, sell mobile phones have been declining profits. In contrast, batteries, cell phone accessories profits up. To obtain benefits, many mobile phones only at the factory is equipped with a battery, which is the emergence of brand cell phone batteries provide name of a certain amount of space.</p>
<p>Hodge-proliferation of mobile phone batteries, to some extent, reduce the use of user effects. Beijing Industry and Commerce Bureau had just released a batch of unqualified list of mobile phone battery, a total of 33 mobile phone batteries on the market Heibang and out of Beijing. It is understood that marks the delisting of products whose documents on excellence, MTS such that 33 kinds of batteries for mobile phones, the main problem is that the signs, performance and discharge cycle life of Other indicators of failure. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-hstnn-lb31.htm">hstnn-lb31</a> , Some phones do not indicate the charge voltage limit, the note of warning, so that consumers can not understand the real situation. Discharge the battery performance is a key quality indicators of good or bad, if not compliance will affect the normal use of cell phone batteries. There are a number of life-cycle of mobile phone battery is too low, which is consumers often complain that the battery can only use a few months on the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>At the same time, the combination becomes more powerful, users requirements of battery capacity increasingly high. In recent years, the industry began widespread use of Bigger, Longer lithium-ion batteries. Previously, the former Ministry of Information Industry promulgated YD1268-2003 &#8220;mobile phones and lithium batteries and charger safety requirements and test methods&#8221;, in which the temperature of testing standards heat shock have been changed to 130 ℃, become the mobile phone industry, to test the general standards of the industry in September 2005 by the State Administration of Quality Supervision,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps2</span></a> ,  Inspection and Quarantine and the National Standardization Technical Committee alkaline batteries under the auspices of the national meeting standard review, the new proposed national standard, &#8220;revised edition&#8221;, in which the temperature standards for thermal shock test in a 130 ℃ However, for various reasons, is due in September 2005 enacted a new national standard has not yet issued. Currently, both the manufacturer of the battery or the mobile phone manufacturers in general would be 130 ℃ as the temperature of the lithium-ion battery testing standards for thermal shock, and the battery design, production, quality control, procurement and other areas commonly used by this standard. Today, batteries new cell phone should also put the national testing standards.</p>
<p>Analysts said that with the smartphone business to grow exponentially, electronics GPS navigation for MP3 music player, and then to access WiFi wireless Internet and so on, the endless variety of functions the phone, waiting time mobile phone becomes the basis for applications to protect these elements.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3284u-1brs.htm">pa3284u-1brs</a> ,  A normal capacity of mobile phone battery apparently can not meet their daily use, this time with high capacity batteries for mobile phones long before cell phone batteries on the market will become the general public.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>IBM researchers are developing solar cells with conventional materials. Researchers AdvancedMaterials papers published, saying that you can use conventional materials, a relatively efficient manufacturing of solar cells. Such cells may be from 9.6% of solar energy into electrical energy, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency higher than 40% of today&#8217;s technologies. This conversion efficiency is much higher than silicon cells available on the market, and even comparable to the efficiency of solar cells in thin layers. IBM&#8217;s use of traditional materials for the manufacture of solar cells, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-u4873.htm">u4873</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-d5318.htm">d5318</a> , such as copper, zinc, tin, sulfur or selenium. IBM said that solar energy technologies used in existing equipment often limited its development.</p>
<p>Companies in the solar industry announced they were using cadmium and tellurium thin-film batteries. GE also plans to begin selling next year, batteries cadmium telluride material. Some small companies like Nanosolar, HelioVolt and Miasolé in the production of copper, indium, gallium and selenium solar cells made of alloy material.</p>
<p>IBM researchers TeodorTodorov, KathleenReuter and DavidMitz the aforementioned shortcomings of the battery is to use either the raw materials are scarce, or the impact on the environment. This means that these batteries need to consider the environmental costs. IBMT.J.Watson Research Laboratory, director of physical sciences ThomasTheis said: &#8220;The other subjects equally effective battery contained in either very expensive or impact on the environment, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f2024a.htm">f2024a</a> , or not much room for further increasing the efficiency, making their business with large size, it was difficult to spread. &#8221;</p>
<p>Compared to conventional batteries, the benefits of thin-film batteries is to use the equipment is relatively low. IBM solar cells can be used to produce manufacturing techniques at high speed, such as &#8220;Rolling Manufacturing Technology&#8221; (roll-to-rollmanufacturing). U. S. National Laboratory for research on Sustainable Energy MatthewBeard involved in the research project of IBM, this technology is a breakthrough. &#8221;</p>
<p>Scientists expected that if the technology can achieve a breakthrough, get 12% of the photoelectric conversion efficiency, resulting in economic costs to completely replace the products of existing solar energy.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps2</span></a></p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>You can buy electric cars? Asked about this issue, many people hesitate: how to open open without electricity? If the battery is what is broken, will not spend much money? JAC Technical Center Co., Ltd. Deputy General Manager Yan Gang Proposed future electric cars as a business model &#8211; the user only buy empty, do not buy batteries,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d420.htm">latitude d420 battery</a> ,  the car died, they open into the station gasoline, change batteries installed OK &#8230; &#8230;</p>
<p>Yan Gang Wu Shier presented JAC will be the end of the training of 100,000 units the ability of new energy vehicles, but &#8220;out of the car is not enough light to do so must be the market must be expanded, he must be adapted to their business model to execute. Gang Yan believes that this business model, need a government, the battery manufacturers, car manufacturers to work together in three areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several problems until the problem is solved, the vehicle of a new energy will inevitably shape the market.&#8221; Yan Gang distributed three issues, and action lists.</p>
<p>The first problem is the cost of the car. &#8220;Car electric battery.&#8221; How to enable users to afford? Yan Gang presents a new point of view: let the future users do not buy batteries, buy only the amount of battery charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s equivalent to the status of owners are now: buy only one vehicle at the gas station to pay only the price of oil each time. But the future is not refueling, but replacement of the load Battery-off of electricity. &#8221; Yan Gang, if this model can be transformed into success in the marketplace, new energy vehicles will be able to exist. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-pp2182l.htm">pp2182l</a> </p>
<p>Secondly, user fees. How can new energy vehicles cheaper than car fuel? Yan Gang calculation, as the current price of gasoline and electricity, is a ratio of 4:1, which is next to a fuel lasts about 4 km dollars, while a single power of money.</p>
<p>Thirdly, easy to use, the proposal Gang Yan can be extended with the current gas stations, refueling areas can also switch to the battery.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must also solve the pollution problem in the battery. Must also be put in place the system battery recycling processing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accordingly, the future, we can develop this type of business model: The government&#8217;s guidelines, the creation of&#8221; posts &#8220;, the companies do a good job of new energy vehicles, the rapid and convenient replacement of &#8216;camera battery, such as buttons security, batteries, pop-up automatically and the same time, rental batteries battery business. &#8221;</p>
<p>Yan Gang believes that this pattern, if achieved,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9-b.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps9/b</span></a> , should Hefei become the first new energy vehicles in the city more efficient.</p>

<p>IBM recently released a new type of solar cell thin films. The battery will be the same battery of 9.6% reached the efficiency of power increased by 40%. Its raw material costs lower than traditional solar cells. IBM has spent 9 months time to develop the solar cell thin film with copper, tin, zinc, selenium, instead of consisting of copper indium selenide Gallium expensive flowers or cadmium telluride as raw material. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-nf343.htm">nf343</a> , In addition, scientists have used a simple solvent, solvent and low prices can not be completely dissolved. IBM said it would be the right time to the form of licensing on the transfer of new technologies.</p>

In this regard, Sharp Business (China) Co., Ltd. the former president of the new extension on the exclusive interview with Xinhua 1st in Shanghai, the regulation indicates that both parties in the technology of the mutual recognition of certificates and a fair evaluation, both parties will be involved in the mutual use of patented technologies, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-630m.htm">inspiron 630m battery</a> , another Sharp LCD technology, the future will continue to turn to China, hoping to achieve with the Chinese industry of &#8216;LCD and common development.</p>
<p>Sharp, Samsung LCD patent dispute settlement</p>
<p>February 5, Sharp and Samsung Electronics have signed the agreement after both parties on LCDs and modules in a settlement of patent disputes, so that the two companies in patent litigation LCD Huashangjuhao. Since 2007, the two companies were in the United States, Japan, Korea and other areas to justice, the other party has violated its own LCD panels and modules in the patent.</p>
<p>Samsung and Sharp for patent litigation between the new extension of the original, &#8220;said Sharp LCD has a multitude of patents, China area Taiwan LCD makers to recognize all of these patents and has signed a patent. Samsung Electronics before the recognition of these patents do not seem to be too. Therefore, in August 2007,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-398876-001.htm">hp 398876-001</a> ,  Sharp against Samsung for patent infringement in the matter of the United States to initiate the procedure, followed by Samsung, Sharp has also filed suit. A total of more than two years, both in the United States, Japan, Korea, Germany, the Netherlands, five countries have launched 21 lawsuits. So far, a total of seven trials have produced results, including five victories Sharp, two in favor of Samsung.</p>
<p>After experiencing more than the trials mentioned above, the two sides reached a settlement at this time has been chosen, the new extension of the original in which there are two actions that are most critical. Was in November 2009 with the International U. S. Trade Commission found violations of Sharp, Samsung&#8217;s LCD modules and panels held by the relevant patent, from January 2010 banned the importation and sale in the use by United States patent Samsung LCD TV and other products and another was in December 2009, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands Samsung Sharp infringed patents to require the sale of Samsung in the Netherlands to stop the import and sales using Samsung undermine the technology. The new extension of the original because the two trials, said the results appear, Samsung Electronics takes the initiative of reconciliation and eventually led to the colony.</p>
<p>Samsung spokesman for the China News also told reporters that the settlement agreement is not a Chinese company does not comment too.</p>
<p>Beijing Guang-Sheng Shanghai Branch Law Firm Chun-Quan Liu lawyer, patent litigation has become an effective tool for competitive business, but once involved in international protracted legal battle, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps13.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps13</span></a> , they often result in loss of both sides, now generally rational if enough is enough, choose reconciliation between business and the great cross of intellectual property licensing approach is generally based on their own commercial interests to maintain a balance.</p>
