                    <div class="entry-content"><p>the rapid development of energy sector in New cars, led the domestic auto business investment boom lithium batteries, and <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">battery</a> manufacturers are multinational companies with joint venture vehicle, signed a supply contract or cooperate with auto parts manufacturers access to customers and others on the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Compared with foreign-invested enterprises, Chinese enterprises have the capacity, the industry chain, and political support has some advantages, but firms with foreign capital in the base material, product segmentation, production processes , more mature. The future, other countries, the car excess capacity lithium battery will accelerate to enter China, facing stiff competition and has launched the car market within the battery, domestic manufacturers and car manufacturers should strengthen other areas outside the chain of cooperative R &amp; D companies, while diversified products of degradation.</p>
<p>The Chinese automotive market situation lithium</p>
<p>    A new energy battery vehicles [1] mainly nickel-hydrogen batteries and lithium batteries, nickel-hydrogen at present China-developed hybrid vehicles, the development of lithium vehicles still in its infancy. The Ni-MH battery production of hybrid vehicles is classified as a mature product, allowing the use of sales nationwide, while the manufacturer of the lithium battery is a hybrid, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9.htm">sony vgp-bps9</a> , pure electric cars are only a trial limited area (2010) [2]. As the high cost, large size of the lithium battery is still mainly used in electric bicycles and public transport vehicles.</p>
<p>    BYD, BAK, the power of God and other domestic companies have begun to produce lithium batteries for cars. Lishen miles with US joint venture for the U.S. to supply car batteries brand Coda, the order of about 2010, 3000. BYD introduced in 2010 on the use of E6 electric car batteries to production.</p>
<p>    In the Chinese market, the potential has not yet published the lithium batteries of the car, but can not say to overcapacity. And no plug-in hybrids compared to power plug-in hybrids and pure electric vehicles to the increased demand for lithium batteries. Chinese companies to actively promote the use of lithium battery electric vehicles, pure electric vehicles in China should become the country&#8217;s fastest growing. January 2010, the public 2008EV Motors electric car market, in addition, BYD E6, Chang BenBen i, Qi Rui Ruiqi M1-EV, the leopard and other game Hafei plans electric cars in the domestic market in 2010.</p>
<p>    Canada supports the national electric cars, plug-in hybrid development, recently began large-scale national car charging station building, which contributed to the growing market for automotive lithium batteries. The current cost of lithium is approximately 3000-4000 Yuan / kWh, and the introduction of new state subsidies on pure electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles standard subsidy is 3000 yuan / kWh. The NiMH battery is the non-plug-in hybrid ordinary, but if the costs can be reduced, lithium batteries are also expected to be further applied to non-plug-in hybrid vehicles, many suppliers were intended. Changan Automobile since the second half of 2010 will make its hybrid vehicles use nickel batteries using lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>Foreign companies to enter the market within the vehicle so lithium</p>
<p>    battery manufacturers foreign and domestic enterprises to establish joint development of pure electric vehicle and the risk of plug-in hybrid cars. The development of these cars has begun to pay more than the cost of R &amp; D, take market risks. SAIC and the lithium battery maker A123 Systems, a company joint venture vehicle battery system. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-y9943.htm">dell y9943</a> , SAIC provides the end of 2012 hybrid cars generally, by the end of 2012 the launch of the plug-in hybrids, and launched in October 2012 of pure electric vehicles. South Korea Li-ion battery maker SK Energy, Korea Electric carmaker CT &amp; T Inc. [3] and Beijing, China Motor Corporation will establish a joint venture to produce and sell electric cars in China. BAI new lines of energy technology of the automobile to develop electric vehicles in operation.</p>
<p>    Motorcycle, electric bike manufacturers began national automobile, the lack of vehicle design and manufacturing experience, but also an urgent development and manufacturing experience with manufacturers of electric cars lithium battery car companies foreign policy. May 8 Zongshen Power Battery Company and Boston have signed the &#8220;Memorandum of Cooperation&#8221;, the two parties the power of the battery and power systems integration to cooperate, both parties will set up joint venture in Chongqing.</p>
<p>    Weak hybrid systems [4] The development has been relatively mature, there are models in the hybrid system of calculating domestic manufacturers of the weakness of many strategies the coming years, bringing a large number of batteries purchased. Changan Automotive: In 2012, all own brand products to meet the low degree hybrid, and LG Chemical Co., Ltd. will provide the Assembly in Changan car batteries hybrid car. SAIC coming year, &#8220;hybrid low&#8221; Roewe 750 cars with a lithium battery Johnson Controls-Saft.</p>
<p>    Li-ion battery manufacturer EnerDel and domestic automotive Wanxiang cooperation group, access to special areas of electric vehicles. The two sides will establish joint venture production of automotive batteries and battery systems, one objective is customer universal heavy trucks. universal car parts in the field of heavy experience with a number of manufacturers of heavy vehicles have a good partnership, and with the development of a battery supply is also very interested, and the main purpose is to EnerDel the Chinese market for cars of the heavy battery. Currently, demand for lithium batteries in the car, little heavy, but also the power systems of traditional experience.</p>
<p>    By combining the characteristics of the local Chinese industry, the batteries of Boston also intends to establish a wide range of lithium products factory. based production company in Boston lithium in Chongqing, including not only the cause of car batteries, but also provided companies in Chongqing lithium battery electric bike, and the supply to the HP plant in Chongqing, the company of consumer electronics with a lithium battery.</p>
<p>Comparison of the competitiveness of Chinese enterprises and foreign</p>
<p>    domestic firms in battery technology, and the battery management system,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1720.htm">dell inspiron 1720 battery</a> ,  production process, it remains to be improved. Most cellular companies do not have the internal design of the system independent of battery management and capacity development, the system&#8217;s internal battery management developed in isolation on small businesses, and many other research institutions, non-academic the mass production of products. Simple battery car battery must be integrated, the key is to ensure the consistency of the battery. Although many national companies have production experience in lithium battery, but the manufacture of car batteries needed for the combination of battery and consistency of the production process does not depend on the magnitude of the investment and improvement can be obtained quickly. Current pure electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid pilot projects are small scale, large scale production can have problems. Nissan technology product consistency lithium took decades to finally finish.</p>
<p>    More domestic firms to produce lithium-ion batteries for electronic products started, extensive product portfolio, but the breakdown products of foreign companies to do better, can be targeted to the market. EnerDel, A123 system, SK Energy and other companies have implemented a system for supplying the perfect battery, covered trucks, appliances, automobiles, etc., and there were different types of new energy vehicles for characteristics of the product range of the battery.</p>
<p>    Chinese companies in the industry chain lithium has certain advantages, but the basic elements of the marginal zone of foreign companies. Relatively complete industrial chain of China Li-ion battery, domestic firms have a long-term cooperation in upstream and downstream to form a stable relationship. Investment in BYD battery industry has been involved in many aspects, including hardware commodity cathode of the battery, the electrolyte and battery components, automotive manufacturing, in addition, the company has built power plants, and ore resources of lithium in the study. The base material of lithium electrolyte LiPF6 are Japanese and Korean corporate monopolies, the domestic production of lithium battery separator has only just begun. SK Group in the production of lithium-ion batteries have gained considerable experience.</p>
<p>    Government support may be the biggest advantage of battery manufacturers. 2010 state validated enterprise technical centers, including car batteries for the first time the scope of research and development. Soon the &#8220;new energy development plan for vehicles, the rate of localization of key pieces can become important.</p>
<p>Outlook and Recommendations</p>
<p>    Other countries, the excess capacity of lithium to enter China as soon as possible, intensifying competition in the domestic market. lithium in Japan can be a lot of excess capacity. Many battery manufacturers have foreign partners stability in international transfers of vehicles,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/compaq-tablet-pc-tc1000.htm">Compaq Tablet PC TC1000 battery</a> ,  these vehicles partners in China has launched a company vehicle, through their channels, will soon enter the market.</p>
<p>    Accelerate the car battery to establish a national unified standard. If all manufacturers of vehicle batteries have different standards, with initial orders for small, battery makers are difficult to scale. Although the market has just begun, the standard set up is very difficult, but it must play a role in the League, to discuss the direction of development. 10 Chinese automakers have formed an alliance composed of the standard T10 Working Group, jointly develop components for electric vehicles and vehicle standards.</p>
<p>    In addition to automakers, the future of the domestic auto manufacturers should also strengthen the industry chain lithium and R &amp; D cooperation of other manufacturers. Compared with ordinary lithium batteries, lithium battery car on the purity of raw materials, quality requirements are high, while Canadian manufacturers of raw materials in the lithium battery that many enter the field. To improve mileage battery life, and more from the battery itself, but also to optimize the body material, improve efficiency, driving to achieve, and these areas must also improve domestic technology.</p>
<p>    calls for release of passengers of lithium batteries will take some time, mass production scale there are some difficulties,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-kd476.htm">dell kd476</a> ,  firms should diversify product segments, to pursue other opportunities. As consumption patterns, costs and infrastructure and other reasons, the popularity of electric vehicles will spread slowly, while public utility vehicle market due to the Government to promote, facilitate the development.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Concept was popular sautéed low-carbon, the decline of the traditional car, people in the coming era of highly anticipated electric car. Let Beijing International Auto Show this year in April or May of the High-Tech Expo, electric vehicles have played an important role in many companies one after another vehicle, said independent research and development pure electric vehicles already on the market or soon will be an essential component of the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">battery</a> is used by many institutions and investors optimistic.</p>
<p>However, if many battery electric vehicles will become a burden on the environment? Geometric money for car battery? The future of battery electric vehicles will be how to develop? These problems have been increasingly concerned.</p>
<p>pollution of the lead-acid battery is serious</p>
<p>As car batteries, the first thought is no doubt lead-acid batteries. Yang Yu-Sheng Chinese Academy of Engineering was established: &#8220;150 years of experience in lead-acid battery is not fading in Nickel &#8211; cadmium, nickel &#8211; hydrogen, batteries lithium new ion battery was launched several years ago, still firmly occupy a large market share, our annual production of nearly 20 million electric bikes, many with lead-acid batteries; different engine in the world, every car is a piece of lead-acid battery, this is not by chance. &#8221;</p>
<p>Lead-acid battery with its mature technology, low cost, high-security benefits of popular support of many car manufacturers, power applications in electric vehicles as a huge market share. But it contains sulfuric acid and lead, it is garbage in one of the most dangerous to the environment a huge pollution problems. Blacksmith Foundation environmental group, said one day: 10 in the world of the most polluting, one of which is the error caused by the removal of lead-acid batteries.</p>
<p>If China is everywhere to see the electric bike, battery on lead-acid batteries the most. battery electric bike is a consumer product,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-studio-15.htm">Dell Studio 15 battery</a> ,  on average about 1 year to be replaced. Insiders have revealed that: scrap the current lead-acid battery, the effectiveness of renovation mainly up to 80% of the new battery, the second repair efficiency of 50% or more, not after three repair value after repair. For any brand of electric vehicle batteries, lead acid, and can still be restored, thanks to special technology of repair, re-entered using, the total damage can be repaired lead-acid batteries acid, recovered by an advance of qualified marketing and zinc, lead refining regenerated. But this recovery is not always good. There are many recycling activities are clandestine laboratories, they will be recycled for lead-acid batteries do not have the conditions stored in the open space or a warehouse, there is no qualification process, resulting in a large number of lead waste and waste a lot of emissions.</p>
<p>Yu-Sheng Yang stressed that the lead pollution of the environment, mainly in the rear of the merger and the regeneration of the battery. The question is whether the relevant ministries seriously. Lead-acid battery production process control and management of lead contamination, must be strengthened.</p>
<p>The high cost of lithium-ion</p>
<p>Compared to lead acid batteries, rechargeable lithium-ion battery with power and energy density, high efficiency, long life, lightweight, non-polluting, self-discharge coefficient is small, the benefits of a wide range of temperature adaptation, has become the direction of development of battery electric vehicles. But its high cost, has become the leader of the lithium-ion electric vehicle market in the kinetic energy, a stumbling block.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Ark Electric Vehicle Co., an employee on the ground at the China Joint Business Daily &#8220;, said the market for pure electric vehicles is now common to lithium iron phosphate, for example, a lithium iron phosphate 72V / 150AH provides up to 40,000 yuan, and even lead-acid batteries offer only 1 million low lithium-ion battery price is obvious.</p>
<p>And because the battery life is low replacement cost is very high. Most domestic manufacturers of lithium batteries are now one year warranty period without a lithium battery, high quality and free of charge warranty period is only two to three years. Thus, a very ordinary performance of electric vehicles, the cost of the battery should be 80 000-10000000, if two or three years after the consumers have to replace the batteries at their own expense, the cost will be enormous.</p>
<p>car battery test</p>
<p>The current high cost has limited the development of the electric car industry an important factor. The cost of electric vehicles include the costs of vehicles and operating cost. vehicle batteries, which cost about half the cost, while the use of electric vehicles is less than the cost of fuel for cars. Therefore, the cost of the battery down, rent the battery business model innovation is the key to the industrialization of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The life cycle of the battery after arrival, the recycling of waste batteries to prevent further pollution of the environment is imperative. Countries should increase the recycling of used batteries in place policies or regulations, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gd761.htm">dell gd761</a> , and operational management of the implementation details of the services of environmental protection at all levels, scientific research units and deal with manufacturers to improve collaboration, early R &amp; D results into productive forces are truly realize the reduction of waste batteries, harmless and resources.</p>
<p>Energy Engineering Research Center, Tianjin University, Director of spinel Media, said: Overall, the development of promising battery, but the market is still low, take time away from the real industry. battery business to really get bigger and stronger, but also resist the industrial scale, large-scale investment in R &amp; D and foreign giants squeeze test.</p>

<p>Laptop battery components for circuit protection are generally regulator block, control tokens, insurance, and temperature sensors. temperature protection device is generally off, the interior has a fuse (fuse about 130 ℃), used to monitor the work unit voltage regulator. If the process of abnormal discharge, immediately there is a current through the guard of the temperature fuse blows, the circuit of the internal battery at this time to the blocked state, and unrecoverable. If you want to repair only the replacement of the protection of temperature, but temperature protector&#8217;s hard to find on the market. Thus, the higher the cost of maintaining the battery.</p>
<p>Using the battery will probably post a loss so that users will find less and less battery &#8220;by use.&#8221; If the loss of cells in large,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-vostro-1520.htm">Dell Vostro 1520 battery</a> ,  you can use special fix restore battery performance, as THINK and other notebooks with the program of power management. If no solution can be repeated 2-3 times the charge and discharge to recover. Some people think to unplug the external power source after the battery is full, and then stop until the batteries run out had completely discharged the. In fact, not. battery warning appears after the shutdown state before entering the BIOS does not work, until the computer is off when the true realization of the full discharge. Also, do not start charging a levy on the shoe, preferably every few minutes, then turn, if the charger is blind, then start charging lantern display flash, not flash until the time of re- boot.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>According CCPIT Electronics &amp; Information Industry Sub report, while crude oil exhausted expectations electric car, hope it can to protect the environment, to a new dynamic. Experiments show that electric vehicles can meet the expectations of people, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d830.htm">dell latitude d830 battery</a> , and find the perfect cell program has been the target of researchers.</p>
<p>If you can really achieve by 2030 the development of the German state, the scene described electric vehicle &#8211; Germany has five million electric cars on the street driving &#8211; let us look back. In the vehicle internal combustion engine was born 30 years ago, electric vehicles already on the road, and create a considerable speed record: 1899 Belgium Camille Jenatzy driving their own vehicles manufactured, faster than 100 km / hour. Turn of the century, power has emerged from the taxi fleet in New York. However, because of the failure to continue to provide energy to the program of the battery electric vehicle, its development has long stagnated.</p>
<p>Compared to internal combustion engine to power the engine power advantages are obvious: speed, fast, power up to 3-4 once, driving noise, and does not require any driver installation. However, the shortcomings of electric vehicles are also an important point is that power always be consumed quickly.</p>
<p>From a global perspective, researchers have considered and developers focus on batteries, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">battery</a> technology lithium-ion represents the current level of research. The early nineties, Sony produced the first small lithium-ion batteries due to its high performance, long life, charging time and short, rapidly in smaller devices like mobile phones, laptops and model aircraft has received application. In the automotive field, but no one wants to use the original battery lithium ion, lithium as electrode material not only causes the voltage is too high, and very easy to do with reactions to other elements.</p>
<p>In the laptop, even light damage batteries and only to extremely high temperatures and under high voltage charge would lead to the loss of the battery cells in the air, causing the computer caught fire. However, the German state of Baden Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology Pfinztal battery researcher Jens Tübke said: &#8220;The car was completely different.&#8221; Motor vehicle battery to store much energy, they may even turn into a bomb. In the laboratory, and factories, single voltage below 3.6 volts, it will change once the short-circuit and thermal expansion, the battery has finished a batch of a single voltage, in such great conditions energy density, even light touch, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>For the user, it is important to recognize that what is most useful in terms of their own.</p>
<p>Safety: the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Würzburg, researcher in the Department of Kai-Christian M? Ller tried polymers non-combustible, flammable liquids to replace the battery, but the jelly-plastic electrodes will impact load time extension can not be performed excellently.</p>
<p>Saxon joint venture Li-Tec has tried other ways to address these security issues. Generally, the battery manufacturers are using a thin plastic membrane that separates the two electrodes, but when the temperature reaches 140 degrees Celsius, they will be like the bottom plate of plastic melt as easily cause short circuit. Li-Tec ceramic particles used as a covering membrane that can withstand 700 degrees Celsius, but the battery is reduced. On the other hand say that the battery charge and discharge shall not be abandoned after 4000, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">sony vgp-bps8</a> , which requires daily recharging electric cars is very important. Li-Tec Corporation will launch next year of this car is safe and durable batteries.</p>
<p>Sustainability: Society Lithiumtitanat can be done with great battery charge and discharge at least 15,000 times (2000 times the operator excellent). The battery life of up to ten years in the medical equipment in the well of the application, the medical technology of great value.</p>
<p>Discharge capacity: If you want to store in a small space more energy, can add Iwo electrode. In theory, Iwo to three times more than conventional polymer electrode of lithium-ion batteries. In the laboratory, this approach may seem bright future, but only charge and discharge of 20-40 times, after an almost unusable.</p>
<p>Fast Charge: If you want fast charge, the iron phosphate of electrode materials for good results. This mobile phone battery can be less than 20 seconds is charged &#8211; at least in the laboratory is the case, but require considerable power.</p>
<p>Safety car batteries, discharge capacity and sustainability are closely related, the consumer, rose, and battery manufacturers in a quandary, one aspect of the increase mainly to the cost of sacrificing other aspects . Pfinztal Tübke battery expert said: &#8220;Fortunately, the system lithium-ion there is still much to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>For battery-electric vehicle using gasoline or diesel-class transportation driving range, and the safe and economic for the moment, or can not be reached, the metal-air battery as well. In the metal-air battery, oxygen from the air was as lithium reagents. IBM Fellow Chandrasekhar Narayan said: &#8220;It&#8217;s like a combustion engine battery. Now the smoke in the air at the vehicle, the combustion of gasoline, the air will be used in the electrochemical reaction future. &#8220;IBM hopes to use this way to the electric vehicle mileage of 800 kilometers &#8211; more that Lithium-ion batteries present beyond 10 times. IBM expected to produce a first sample five years, while other researchers should be extremely cautious in this research program requires a lot of time in decades.</p>
<p>Finally, we discuss an old program that was originally designed for the storage of fixed energy: do not charge the battery, but the fuel. In redox flow battery technologies, energy is not stored in the electrodes, but stored in a liquid electrolyte in the battery. Redox technology currently low capacitance. Fraunhofer Institute, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9.htm">sony vgp-bps9</a> , Institute of Jens Noack technology sector, said: &#8220;We have passed the effectiveness of its range of more than 4-5 times, he had followed very similar to lithium-ion batteries. &#8221;</p>
<p>This, Tübke excited and worried: &#8220;The idea of high drama, but over the next 20 years or 30 years, still can not resolve the difficulties we have encountered.&#8221;</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>With smart phones in the functional aspects of continuous improvement, the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">battery</a> life, and life is increasingly unable to meet the needs of users. smart phone users complain that the mobile power capacity faster than the consumption of sweets to children. Currently, a new rechargeable battery for portable electronics manufacturing technology to solve this problem is the dawn of a new technology for producing electricity from the batteries to function created by the store ten times the current of the battery.<br />
MIT scientists have found a great use for the end of the battery electrode with carbon nanotubes can be more than the current lithium power Xucun. Scientists in the laboratory using the multi-cell cathode carbon nanotubes, using the manufacture of anodes of lithium titanium oxide. This charger efficiency and charge storage capacity than most Lithium upscale better. To test the battery using carbon nanotubes in the course of life, the new R &amp; D scientists with carbon nanotubes 1000 battery charge and discharge experiments. Results in 1000, after the release, including the material properties of carbon nanotubes changes the battery is low, the batteries store the energy not less. This also shows that carbon nanotubes containing lithium batteries have a longer life than that.</p>
<p>The use of smartphones and other users of portable electronics, it&#8217;s probably good news. However, the current battery with carbon nanotubes not only in laboratories. Controlling the spread of the major reasons for the new battery is made with carbon nanotubes in the battery electrode substrate before the batteries need to be dissolved in the solution to soak two different, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-mini-12.htm">Dell Inspiron Mini 12 battery</a> ,  and this process is very long. MIT Department of Chemical Engineering Paula Large Professor &#8211; Hammond (Hammond Paula) said that his research team are currently working to find a solution to this problem. Currently the most viable proposal for the substrate with carbon nanotubes by spray to replace the battery of alternative substances dissolve in the process of soaking solution time.</p>
<p>I think the battery is made with carbon nanotubes in the near future can be listed, then use the user&#8217;s smart phone will no longer be necessary for problems such as power enough trouble.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>1, right Do not update the system of the iPhone, so you do not upgrade to version 1.13 or 1.1.4 and then downgrade, activate, jailbreak, piracy, ah, really bad.</p>
<p>2, iPhone Bluetooth Headset Bluetooth just does not support file transfers, this points to note.</p>
<p>3, iPhone does not normally see the cities on the map, if not see if the form can be obtained by the card off-line.</p>
<p>4, said that the iPhone screen is a capacitive multi-touch, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1175.htm">apple a1175</a> , there is no brush classic diseases of the reaction, must use the finger belly, not the nail tip, indicating the note. Keyboards hand operation can be carried by fat, do not worry the wrong position.</p>
<p>5, iPhone and other software via the Outlook synchronization of contacts and other information, but some areas, the need for careful matching, otherwise it appears the phenomenon of missing numbers.</p>
<p>6 iPhone does not support current version of Flash Player, the Flash part of the web page appears blank, there are signs the application.</p>
<p>7, iPhone does not support copy and paste, it is fatal. Therefore, SMS should be sent by the address book number, must rely on SMSD or iSMS can. If you want to visit the SMS Web site is not marked, it was out of the pen, and think of here teeth. employment estimate of memory, do not copy and paste this fool of a tool, haha. .</p>
<p>8 iPhone can not arbitrarily change the battery if the batteries need to dismantle aging or failure to replace the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">battery</a>, professional maintenance staff is not recommended for people disassemble the interview.</p>
<p>9 iPhne data are stored in the Flash inside the 300M system partition, the rest of the data partitions used to store music and photos. So do not lose data when the battery is discharged, the time may be needed to address.</p>
<p>10 iPhone handset on top of the infrared sensor can detect if your face on the screen, if found near the screen automatically turns off the screen, it&#8217;s human nature, could s prevent remind me of my SLR. Currently on the market only a few sheets of metal to make a few test holes are blocked, so that we can not face near the screen closed shows that we must be careful.</p>
<p>11, many of my friends said to get the voice of the iPhone handset is too small, had to use hands-free calls. In fact, he did not tear your protector, blocking the votes of the unit, as the tear film can protect the phone normal hearing. If you do not want to tear the protective film, you can recharge with a knife to the appearance of the handset, the sound will be great Oh great. Be careful not to cut the speaker.</p>
