                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Chemical battery discharge curve will largely determine the efficiency that you can from your voltage regulator system, in fact, the power supply chain is that you should chemical battery discharge curve will largely determine the efficiency that you voltage regulator from your system.</p>
<p>The performance of lithium-ion battery will discharge rate under different temperature, from the initial voltage reading to actual differences.</p>
<p>If you draw the ability to change the voltage in the home game against the changes, you get a peak discharge capacity of representative (50 percent empty) and the representative of the ability of the voltage change per unit volume of the slope, midpoint. The phone uses a lithium ion battery, for example, the peak flow capacity of about 3.6 volts positive.</p>
<p>However, the higher the peak, the greater the voltage change per unit of battery capacity. In other words, a greater volume changes, discharge the battery faster. If you flatten the slope (and lower peak), it may only appear that you have reduced you, that the ability of 3.6 or 3.5: but to reduce emissions rate, you may increase, such as the battery&#8217;s energy available to you , 2.8,2.5 or 2 Why is it important?</p>
<p>For the system as a battery status indicator on the battery voltage, during the reading of the battery voltage discharge of a small error could lead to large errors in estimation ability. In addition, the peak moves down the exhaust temperature decreases.</p>
<p>Therefore, the system running time will be shortened considerably lower temperature, but there is still a very large battery capacity available for operation of the system, although at a lower voltage.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is a topology based on adaptive power lithium-ion battery remaining capacity of the low battery cutoff, and to allow the discharge voltage lower than the typical 3 &#8211; or 3.3V fixed cutoff voltage. Using this program, the system can run more of the cell&#8221;&#8217;&#8217;s life cycle and the use of different temperature can be predicted.</p>
<p>For many consumer electronics products, this solution will allow the use in all environments, more consistent action and the life of the system. This is particularly useful in the system&#8217;s battery is not likely to be removed or if the mobile phone or MP3 player, changed regularly.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>9. With the help of special tools. Facing more and more types of mobile phone batteries in the market, at the same time the counterfeit technology is becoming more sophisticated. so large companies are constantly improving anti-counterfeiting technologies, such as the new Nokia mobile phone batteries, its signs carried out a special deal, which needs a special prism to identify, and this prism only Nokia have. Thus, with the improvement of security technology, we are also difficult to distinguish which battery is a fake one from appearance.</p>
<p>10. Using special detectors. It is hard to distinguish the quality of mobile phone batteries from the appearance. So a mobile phone battery tester is launched in the market. This detector can test between 2.4V-6.0V, a capacity of 1999mAH lithium within, nickel and other battery capacity, and it has started, charging, discharging and so on features. The whole process from the microprocessor to control by the battery characteristics, enabling digital display the measured voltage, current, capacity and other technical parameters.</p>
<p>11. Lithium-ion cell phone batteries outside are general signed in English 7.2Vlithiumionbattery (Li-ion battery) or 7.2Vlithiumsecondarybattery (lithium secondary battery), 7.2Vlithiumionrechargeablebattery lithium-ion rechargeable battery). So when you buy a mobile phone battery you need to see signs of battery appearance.</p>
<p>12. People often overlook a small detail &#8212; the contacts on the battery. Because various brands of mobile phone battery, the contacts are mostly annealed, it should be matt not shiny, so it can be according to the preliminary determination about the authenticity of cell phone batteries. Furthermore, we need look closer at the contacts to the color, the fake phone battery is often made of copper, so its color is red or white. But the genuine batteries  should be pure yellow, red or whitish on both may be false.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>5. Currently, many mobile phone manufacturers think from their own point of view, they improve the process levels to enhance cell phone and accessories forge difficulty to further curb the spread of parallel fake. General formal requirements of mobile phones and accessories must be consistent in appearance. So after we bought the battery, we should be careful to contrast battery body and bottom shell. If coloris the same with the original battery, it is the origianl one. Otherwise the battery itself is dull, it may be a counterfeit one.</p>
<p>6. Observing charging anomalies. General, genuine mobile phone batteries should have over-current protection device internal. When external short circuit leads large current flow, it can cut off the circuit automatically so as not to burn or damage the device. Lithium-ion batteries also have over-current protection circuit, when the use of non-standard electrical appliances, AC electric current is too large, will automatically cut off power supply, resulting in charge do not enter, in normal circumstances the battery can be automatically restored to the conduction state. If, in charge of the process we found that severe heat or smoke the battery, or even an explosion, the battery is definitely false.</p>
<p>7. Look at security signs carefully. Such as stickers hidden under the ramp NOKIA printed words, is one of the tips.</p>
<p>Clear is the original product flawless; eclipse counterfeit products.  If the scan may also be found in manufacturer&#8217;s name. For example, Motorola batteries, it&#8217;s anti-counterfeit trademarks are diamond-shaped, and from whatever point of view, can flash a three-dimensional effect, while Motorola, Original and printing and clear, then it should be genuine. On the contrary, once the color of dark, three-dimensional feeling inadequate, vague words, there may be fakes.</p>
<p>8. Measuring battery charging voltage. If Ni-Cd and Ni-MH battery block counterfeit lithium-ion cell phone battery block, it must be composed of five individual cells, a single battery charge voltage not more than 1.55V, the battery voltage does not exceed the total block of 7.75V. The total charge when the battery block is possible when the voltage is lower than 8.0V is nickel-cadmium, nickel-hydrogen batteries.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>1. Comparing of the size of the battery capacity. Average Ni-Cd battery is 500mAh or 600mAh, and NiMH battery is lower than 800-900mAh. The capacity of lithium-ion cellphone batteries generally are between 1300-1400mAh, so after ithium-ion battery is fully charged, its using time is about 1.5 times of the NiMH battery and 3 times of Ni-Cd battery. If you find that your lithium-ion cell phone battery&#8217;s work time is shorter than the instruction, it may be a fake battery.</p>
<p>2. The plastic surface and plastic materials. Genuine battery wear uniform surface is using the PC material, no embrittlement; counterfeit batteries are not wear surface or too rough, recycled materials used are easy to brittle</p>
<p>fracture.</p>
<p>3. All mobile phone batteries&#8217; appearance should be neat, no more than the rest of the burr, the outer surface has some roughness and feel comfortable; inner surface feels smooth, it can be seen the fine vertical scratches under light. Cell phone battery electrode and the width of the same piece, the battery electrode below the corresponding position marked with [+],[-] tag battery electrode materials and housing materials, the same isolation but not together.</p>
<p>4. For the original battery, its battery surface color and texture are clear, uniform, clean, no scratches and damage; battery symbol should be printed on the battery model, type, rated capacity, standard voltage, positive and negative signs, factory name.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>At present, Lithium-ion battery is divided into the liquid lithium-ion battery (LIB) and lithium ion polymer battery (PLB). Among them, the liquid lithium-ion battery is the Li + intercalation compound as the positive and negative secondary battery. LiCoO2 cathode using lithium compounds or LiMn2O4, negative use of lithium &#8211; carbon intercalation compounds. Lithium-ion batteries because of high voltage, small size, light weight, high energy, no memory effect, no pollution, little self-discharge, long cycle life, is ideal for the development of 21st century energy.<br />
Successful development in 1992, Sony lithium-ion battery. It&#8217;s practical to make people&#8217;s mobile phones, laptops and other portable electronic devices greatly reduced weight and size. Greatly extend the usage time. As the lithium-ion batteries do not contain heavy metals cadmium, nickel-cadmium batteries, compared with significantly reduced environmental pollution.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>1: Do not covet cheap used battery.</p>
<p>First, be sure to choose to purchase a large manufacturer of authentic battery, try not to use non-original batteries, charger. When the battery is a problem that can help to battery manufacturers, repair and replacement.</p>
<p>2: Do not charge too long.</p>
<p>Many of my friends are used to recharge at night, wake up do not know how long the battery is fully charged.</p>
<p>Battery as much as possible to avoid more than 12 hours charging time. If conditions permit, then the battery is full when it should stop charging, to avoid unnecessary damage to the battery according to Cheng.</p>
<p>3: Don&#8217;t charge your battery until the electricity has used out</p>
<p>It has been the cell phone battery appears low warning , he still do not charge to use the example has been used in automatic shutdown. The results in this example was charging the phone and boot in no response, had to give customer service overhaul. In fact, this is the result of excessive discharge as a result of the battery voltage is too low, so do not have a normal result of the charge and start conditions.</p>
<p>4: Note water and moisture.</p>
<p>Batteries should pay attention to moisture to prevent falls, avoid high temperature storage and charging as much as possible not to charge state called for a long time without cell phones, then take the battery out.</p>
