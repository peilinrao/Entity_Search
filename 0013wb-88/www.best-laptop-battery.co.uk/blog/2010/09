They visited detailed at car styling shop, electric car charging stations, mobile energy storage power plants, automobile assembly plant, solar power plants and automobile testing center.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the president of Mr. Wang Chuanfu BYD Buffett shows the future to address the energy crisis of the human range of solutions &#8211; using solar power, energy storage power station by moving to form a distributed network, home with cabinet (away from the net) energy system (see it at &#8220;BYD Solar energy: solar energy with Buffett also favored&#8221;). What if electric vehicles running in the streets with no electricity? just call a board installed in the car kcal energy storage power station will be able to meet any supply emergency situation.</p>
<p>The concept immediately attracted great interest by Mr. Buffett, he expressed the hope that Mr. Wang Chuanfu next general meeting of Berkshire shareholders on display to the world.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Battery is a variety of portable electronic products. It is important and annoying. Especially these large and heavy batteries, thier mobile devices are even worse, while the smaller battery, it will cause the device to low performance or battery life shorter &#8211; or both. But for now, Stanford is not a new type of lithium-ion batteries to reduce the number but to reduce the size. The new ultra-thin, rechargeable batteries can be produced in a piece of paper. They are lightweight, flexible and is easy as that piece of A4 paper.</p>
<p>This is made by a materials scientist at Stanford University. The film surface of carbon nanotubes is coated with another metal in the lithium compound nanotubes. These thin film layer on both sides of plain paper on the paper are used as the support structure of the battery, but also play a role in the electrode separation.</p>
<p>As a result, the battery is only 300 microns thick &#8211; a flexible and ultra-thin, and better energy efficiency than other batteries. This is not a one-time charge battery. It been tested for more than 300 cycles, and its performance remaines satisfactory. And this battery is not difficult to produce high, even more easily than other thin cells commercially oriented approach.</p>
<p>This battery is not ideal accessories for all devices, but they may useful for future, such as intelligence Packaging, RFID applications, and electronic of paper products.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, the 100 MW Czochralski silicon solar cells and components project was put into production at the Optical Valley, East. Since the project technology significantly reduce the amount of polysilicon solar cell materials, so the product is known as the world&#8217;s lowest-cost solar cells.</p>
<p>It is understood that the project is a Nasdaq listed companies in the United States in the Chinese investment in Evergreen Solar&#8217;s Iger solar energy, cooperating with Jia Wei construction, the total investment is 450 million U.S. dollars, and the first project an annual capacity is 100 megawatts. In brief, these batteries provide power supply to about 20,000 households a year of China&#8217;s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>The project consumes 3.5 grams of polysilicon solar power with outputs 1 watt, only 50% of solar cells currently on the market. As the global solar market is getting warmer, Chinese Evergreen Solar CEO Richard Felt revealed that by 2015, the project is expected to expand production capacity to produce 1,500 megawatts, can provide jobs 1.5 10 000 and the output value 2,000,000,000 yuan.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>California Public Utilities Commission is ambitious to plan building 1,940 MW solar power by 2016. Currently the company has already funded a point of energy projects for SunPower and ICE. The project will combine its ICE ICE Energy storage with solar photovoltaic systems.</p>
<p>Ice Energy co-founder Greg Tropsa said considering it as a combination of solar, wind and ice, it may be more valuable than all three techniques being used alone. Part of the California Solar Initiative&#8217;s research, development, deployment and demonstration are seeking more efficient photovoltaic system, which in theory will reduce commercial energy storage for peak power requirements.</p>
<p>The project will demonstrate that solar energy storage and ice storage can significantly reduce the electricity peak demand, which will save consumers money, help reduce utility peak load power plants on fossil fuel demand generator.</p>
