                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Following the announcement to invest $ 450 million in the early development of the next generation of plug-in hybrid project, a few days ago, Ford invested $ 135 million has been announced for the development and production of batteries electrical accessories and bridges player, car shows this traditional giant fields in the determination of new energy vehicles. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1150.htm">inspiron 1150 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1300.htm">inspiron 1300 battery</a></p>
<p>The direction of these flows Ford can be seen, the current Ford in the new field of energy research and development focused on electric field: the beginning of last year, Ford announced a rather radical strategy that Electrification, which covers three types of electric vehicle: Electric Cars (BEV), hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV).</p>
<p>The next three years, Ford plans to launch five new vehicles in North American energy market. 2012, Ford 10% to 30% will be new models of energy technologies, batteries are all lithium <a href="http://www.batterysupport.com">battery</a>.</p>
<p>The time, Ford is primarily a consumer promote vigorously &#8220;affordable&#8221; technology &#8212; the traditional gasoline engine and PowerShift EcoBoost technology used, fuel-efficient than traditional techniques of 20% and 15% of carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>Current &#8220;affordable&#8221; for emissions reduction technology EcoBoost PowerShift cons + + public TSI DSG</p>
<p>In China, the fuel consumption of products Ford has always been a big concern. For high fuel rumors, Ford sought to demonstrate by concrete actions, the host city, including Ultimate Challenge 2009 fuel and other activities,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d500.htm">latitude d500 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d505.htm">latitude d505 battery</a> ,  invite customers actually experience. However, those who do not buy Ford products, consumers remain skeptical about.</p>
<p>Now, Ford is finally here, the technology of Chinese technology highly anticipated new EcoBoost engine &#8212; which is an energy-new Ford in the near future to solve one of the most important strategy. EcoBoost uses turbocharging and direct injection technology to improve fuel efficient fuel economy by 20%, 15% of carbon dioxide emissions while reducing engine size, and improve the dynamic behavior of motor . Because of its advanced nature, the EcoBoost technology has received a boost as much as 125 U.S. patents and patent applications, with EcoBoost technology and new PowerShift6 speed automatic transmission support, and now Ford has begun to fuel economy than its products in China an important part of the strategy.</p>
<p>Shen, president of Changan Ford Mazda stress British public, and technology EcoBoost PowerShift is sufficient to meet public TSI + DSG technology, more than one in some areas. More importantly, this technology affordable for consumers, it simply is not as expensive as hybrids.</p>
<p>Ford plans to their cars to large trucks ranging from a full range of products to use EcoBoost. 2013 will be 90% of its vehicles in North America offer EcoBoost engines. This technology will first be applied to new Ford Lincoln MKS, followed the next year launched the Lincoln MKT, Ford and TaurusSHO FLX Series. Within three years, Ford is expected to sell 750,000 per year in North America with EcoBoost engine cars in the world 1.3 million dollars per year.</p>
<p>In China, Ford Mondeo clearly first &#8211; win [photo review Forum vehicles] at senior level with this new technology, new car market is expected in September this year. In future, all Ford products in China will carry out this new technology.</p>
<p>Radical development program covers electric vehicles BEV, HEV, PHEV three  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d600.htm">latitude d600 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d610.htm">latitude d610 battery</a> </p>
<p>Through the technology EcoBoost, the future, Ford has been the site medium-term energy solutions &#8212; the new electric vehicles in the area.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford believes the current global automotive industry is in the &#8220;economic, energy, environment,&#8221; the three big global issues at the intersection. Firms can differentiate themselves not only the need address these issues, and its production of cars must also be exciting and full of fun at the same time not losing performance.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, Ford last year announced a radical strategy for the electrification of vehicles, which involves three types of electric vehicles: pure electric vehicles (BEV), hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), plug- in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). It is almost the plane of the most complete development of electric vehicles, most of existing attacks or principal of both companies are often the technology of electric vehicles. February 2009, Ford was also known for its battery power and advanced development work vehicle of Michigan $ 55 million in tax incentives.</p>
<p>For the strategy of Ford electric vehicle Why not the same as other car companies have focused, Ford Motor (China) Ltd. Chairman and CEO of GE Cheeroll said: &#8220;We do not see a solution that can cope with any single the challenges facing the world, so we simultaneously three types of technology research and development purposes. &#8221;</p>
<p>cars not long ago, Ford announced the next three years to promote the electric vehicle program, Ford five hybrid vehicles on the market. Including, in 2010, to launch electric vehicles Ford Transit Connect commercial vehicles launched Fox in 2011 [Photo Review] Forum Electric in 2012 the next generation of mid-size car based on Ford&#8217;s global platform for the construction of the hybrid and plug-in hybrid car power.</p>
<p>Ford executives said the technology Ford 2012 new power will cover 10-30 per cent of vehicles, new energy in the two years of more than 2 million vehicles sold.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ford was the battery and providers, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4812a.htm">f4812a</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-hstnn-lb31.htm">hstnn-lb31</a> , utilities and governments to develop, test and verify the performance of electric vehicles in transportation, to accelerate commercialization of this technology. Last year in August, Ford has also announced its development of a set of plug-in hybrid intelligent &#8220;cars on the grid&#8221; system of communication and control. The system will be able to network with American power directly &#8220;exchange&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sustainability vision [photo review forum] is trying to hydrogen fuel cell technology R &amp; D vehicle</p>
<p>In addition to developing electric cars, the Ford engine in the bio-fuel and clean diesel engines in the field have also been tried on several occasions. Ford currently has more than 5 million flexible fuel vehicles (FFV) Mercedes-Benz on the road in the world. Ford, on the various markets around the world has launched a total of 14 flex-fuel vehicles. Ford will continue to present to the use of renewable fuels (such as bio-diesel and ethanol is produced E-85). Ford U.S. has pledged, provided that the fuel and the necessary infrastructure in place, the latest products in 2012 so that it can rely on alternative fuels half the traffic.</p>
<p>Ford said that sustainable development should be more product markets in the diesel engine. In Europe, Ford ECOnetic ultra-low carbon vehicles in the series of low-emission performance of consumers concerned about providing a lot of attractive and affordable option.</p>
<p>If these programs are the hallmarks of the transition program, Ford will be the hydrogen fuel cells as the ultimate solution. Ford has been going on all the basic technology research on fuel cells and hydrogen development. By 30 to hydrogen Ford Focus fuel cell vehicle fleet including road tests the actual total distance traveled over a million miles.</p>
<p>However, despite the vehicles running on hydrogen promising, but costs remain high and the technology infrastructure of hydrogen station, the lack of challenge. Therefore, the current emphasis on investment in Ford&#8217;s EcoBoost technology, promotion and research and development on electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s new energy strategy will also cover the Chinese market. Ford executives said the new energy in the planning of various car models, Ford is ready to achieve their production and market in China. However, there are incentives for new domestic energy, unclear, infrastructure construction has begun, if Ford is still awaiting the right moment. &#8220;Until the right time, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">vgp-bps8</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm">vgp-bps8a</a> , Ford&#8217;s new energy technologies will be introduced in China in the first instance,&#8221; President of Changan Ford Mazda Shen Ying Quan said.</p>
<p>Perspective</p>
<p>Only the large scale application to change the world</p>
<p>Ford Another feature of the development of new energy is very sensitive to these programs can be universal, including the two directions: technology can be widely used, and reasonable prices. &#8220;We have focused on R &amp; D can be applied to thousands of cars and sustainable technological solutions, not just hundreds or thousands of cars vehicle technology, because for large-scale, Ford can really make the world change! &#8220;Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally (AlanMulally) said.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Mainland second computer company Founder Technology (600601.SH), and the second largest manufacturer of self Acer Baotuan children decided to break the Lenovo Group (00992.HK) because of the dominance of the situation the mainland market. Acer announced May 27 in Beijing University Founder Group, with the intention to achieve strategic cooperation, saying bilateral cooperation will involve the PC, PCB (Printed Circuit Board, which is printed panels, is an important component e) , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-vostro-1400.htm">Vostro 1400 battery</a>  , and e-books, etc. &#8220;all areas of computing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;office of the founder, Acer advantage, the two parts together, we are positioned as the third largest market for PCs in China, but with a small gap between HP in second place. The next step is the second fight. &#8220;Acer Global CEO Gianfranco Lanci said Acer is the founder and Chinese on the desktop and the canal networks of after-sales and other benefit, cooperation means that Acer covering quick access to the market after-sales network 6.4, founder of 10,000 across the country will advance a number of stores that sell Acer, Acer Power in China &#8220;greatest.&#8221; Founder hopes that cooperation with Acer access more Rapid international markets.</p>
<p>Gartner Asia-Pacific Hardware Systems Group senior analyst Lei Ye think that in the past, China&#8217;s why Acer has opened up the situation, mainly the lack of strong support network and cooperation with the founder undoubtedly bring a piece rate relatively high short board. Regarding the cooperation of the future impact of the domestic PC industry will depend upon close cooperation between the two sides &#8211; after all parties have repeatedly stressed that the cooperation will be limited to companies, public enterprises and property rights are relatively independent, &#8220;not involve cross-shareholdings, it does not produce mergers. &#8221;</p>
<p>The cooperation does not involve mergers and acquisitions   <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1520.htm">inspiron 1520 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1521.htm">inspiron 1521 battery</a></p>
<p>Cooperation is a realistic option, but it is a negotiation process long and difficult. With regard to cooperation on the occasion, Founder Group, the directors, director general Lee was in the company &#8220;China&#8221;, an interview, said that both sides in recent years by the PC in the field trade cooperation easier.</p>
<p>Back in 2007, Acer CEO JT Wang said it is not outside the country for a suitable acquisition to strengthen Acer&#8217;s market share in China. This time, many predicted, Acer acquired or TCL Founder most likely. Today, TCL Computer has been sold, founder remains second in the domestic market share were HP, Dell, catch up and discusses the advantages of the office market was able to graft onto the market Portable rapid growth in the international community is a more distant goal. But is this a business cooperation with foreign or Taiwan, the founder is an internal debate on the issue, after all, Founder Group, a background of state-owned enterprise.</p>
<p>Gartner data shows that the first quarter of 2010, Lenovo PCs (including desktop and laptop) with 23.3% market share ranking of the continent first, second market share from Hewlett-Packard was 10.3%, the third bit is Dell, the market share of 8.1%, Founder, Acer, were 6.2% and 3.2%.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the PC giant&#8217;s aggressive foreign aggression, on the one hand, the brand has extended the olive branch to Taiwan, Founder Group, began in the cabinet, but the beginning of negotiations, a high-voltage wire hanging over his head &#8211; to keep the two brands listed companies and their independence, no cross-holdings, does not include mergers and acquisitions. &#8220;Acer and Founder Prior to signing a strategic cooperation agreement, both parties reached an assent, is the basis of bilateral cooperation.&#8221; Lee has repeatedly stressed.</p>
<p>For the past two years by the acquisition of Gateway, PB, eMachine rapidly in Europe and the United States market, thereby strengthening the global market share of Acer, the first three, which is obviously not the best result but at least it was a good try.</p>
<p>Acer and Founder Group signed a memorandum of cooperation on the screen, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">vgp-bps8</a>  , Acer will participate in planning brand founder provision, research and development and design, including laptops, netbooks and mobile interconnection equipment, such that the e-Reader. At the same time, Acer will take the majority of sales channels and influence Founder PC market, particular from 4 to 6 cities, rural and commercial customers and government clients the advantage of expanding market segments such as the continental market. In addition, the two sides will also discuss other products related to business cooperation PC, such as intellectual property, supply chain and customer service and other areas.</p>
<p>Lanci said, from June, the two sides will enter into detailed negotiations with the team to discuss the Founder and industry on the office market, sales channels and after-sales service and other benefits, and Acer in notebook and consumer markets and design and production on the benefits of the merger.</p>
<p>Grab market share</p>
<p>China&#8217;s current strategic position on the mainland market is increasingly emphasized, &#8220;the next one to two years, China will become the world&#8217;s largest PC market and the fastest growth,&#8221; said Wang Zhentang Acer president. The mainland market is the largest market share in depression macro.</p>
<p>IDC&#8217;s latest figures show that Acer has been the overall share of notebook market 19.4% occupied, beyond the HP as the first, and in the global PC market overall, Acer ranked second. In Europe and the United States and other developed markets as well as India, Brazil and Russia, Acer market position are the top three, but in the mainland market, Acer ranked at least fifth place. Some analysts believe that cooperation with Acer and Founder, is the ability of Acer has made an important step in emerging markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, the most important market in China is to increase market share.&#8221; Lanci said.</p>
<p>Wang CEO Lanci has admitted that the macro failed on the mainland market because it is over-estimated sales channels on the Acer continental market and consumer behavior to understand the mainland sales channels are not dominant supermarkets, distributors are also very important, while the continent is also a consumer desktop market, so that cooperation with the founder, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-417066-001.htm">417066-001</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-346970-001.htm">346970-001</a> , will address these two issues. &#8221;</p>
<p>In April 2009, as chairman of Acer in China Yi Rensi in a media interview, he mentioned at the beginning Acer assume some hope that major retailers (national package) for three levels of market expansion Chinese, but found little effect. Later, Acer hired Yong-Heng Zhang HP as executive vice president, a complete copy of HP very successful in recent years, &#8220;grid pattern of channels.</p>
<p>However, the prospects of bilateral cooperation, the industry is not very optimistic. &#8220;Who finally cooperation between the last word, is a very important issue because there is no option of support, cooperation between the two is difficult to fit into the company.&#8221; Lei Ye think.</p>
<p>Observer reporter</p>
<p>Battle of the cage Chinese PC</p>
<p>The first four on the worldwide PC market, Chinese firms Acer, Lenovo will have two seats, this is quite proud of pieces of things, but precisely because both companies share the same cultural gene, thus necessarily always be laid for comparison. The results of this comparison, the natural antagonism between the two will eventually be a situation such as fire and water situation.</p>
<p>ambitions of market share with a couple does not talk, the two Chinese companies enter the market trends, international operations and other aspects of their own characteristics, it is deducted.</p>
<p>Like many companies in the continent, the majority of Taiwanese companies is at the heart of the technical capacity to grasp, but they are, after, after several years of OEM and ODM, product specifications with an understanding deep in the manufacture and management of the supply chain has also indicated that it is and why. Therefore, when the industry will change radically, they can &#8220;Happy ducks plumbing&#8221;, the first to introduce more in line with future trends of integrated products. Such as Asus and Acer in the netbook market, success is a good example. Acer part of the last two years to improve the global marketplace depends largely on its rapid transformation of the notebook market, seize business opportunities in the consumer market. Lenovo&#8217;s consumer markets, while relying on the idea just begun. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-btp-58a1.htm">btp-58a1</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-btp-63d1.htm">btp-63d1</a></p>
<p>In the international context, the two companies have also chosen a different path. President of China&#8217;s world president of the European elections are Acer &#8211; Italian row, Germany Yi Rensi, more than half of the executives are not Chinese; the past year, the association by bitter experience, the result operational once again be back in Chinese hands, and turned last year, Lenovo&#8217;s strong corporate culture &#8211; that we have a distinct Chinese characteristics. It is not surprising that China is still the seat of the strongest association, but also determine the future direction of the global PC market. Acer chairman JT Wang has even admitted that &#8220;the next one to two years, China will become the largest and fastest growing PC market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, Acer and Lenovo PCs planes inevitably clashed in the Chinese market. Currently, Acer is the most lacking in the capacity of channel management market in China, which is an Acer too few troops in the Chinese investment has a direct relationship. For China, 46 markets, which open a business does not depend on the situation of human wave tactics? Acer and Founder of cooperation, because they have no equity, should be a temporary solution. For a more realistic option Acer, Hewlett-Packard may be made to find a more realistic approach to their own.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>The new Sino-American energy companies will jointly set up in Inner Mongolia, China thinner amorphous silicon film battery factory. On May 26th Sino-US forum on renewable energy, energy savings in China and the U. S. Environmental Protection Group Applied Materials solar photovoltaic technology to accelerate development and deployment of the signing of a memorandum of cooperation. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-nf343.htm">nf343</a>，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-pc764.htm">pc764</a></p>
<p>Cooperation is the main content of energy conservation group plans the environment in Inner Mongolia to build a plant of 5 MW of solar power, the first use of amorphous silicon thin-film modules, the new Austrian Photovoltaic Energy Co ., Ltd. was awarded the project, the use of Applied Materials Company SunFab production line of 5.7 square meters SunFab double junction thin-film modules.</p>
<p>NDRC Energy Research Institute, Li Junfeng, deputy director, said: &#8220;Austria is 5.7 square meters of new battery in thin films of large size is the biggest battery amorphous silicon thin film power projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vice-president of Renmin University of China International Studies, Institute for climate change and low carbon as the head of Yang, a substantial increase in the efficiency of photovoltaic power generation is also lower than their costs is an important way. This regard, the United States, solar technology, power transmission is relatively mature, China&#8217;s future should be the aim of introducing technology.</p>
<p>Enter the growth potential of Chinese market</p>
<p>Last year, the Group has developed energy saving of 20 megawatts of solar energy and electricity generation projects, and today the company has scheduled 150 MW. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1520.htm">inspiron 1520 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1521.htm">inspiron 1521 battery</a>, Applied Materials Asia-Pacific Market Development and Sales Director XIAO Jin-Song accept the &#8220;Daily Economic News&#8221; interview, said trophies with such cooperation is central to promoting business and affairs of the solar energy company in China a good opportunity for development.</p>
<p>Applied Materials is the world&#8217;s largest chip of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, flat panel display and solar photovoltaic industry suppliers. Ke-Ping Ma, executive vice president of the company on the New &#8220;Economic Daily&#8221;, the company said in hardware manufacturing crystalline silicon, 75% of orders come from the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Ke-Ping Ma said, according to research results for the third party, the Chinese market, the number of megawatts of solar cells represent 50% of the global market, according to research institutions report on the IRA, Applied Materials, Inc. in the world market production of solar photovoltaic equipment is to occupy first.</p>
<p>In 2009, operating profit of the company in the field of solar photovoltaics to reach one billion U.S. dollars for investments in the field of crystalline silicon will continue to rise, Ke-Ping Ma believes that the market size will grow.</p>
<p>MA Ke-Ping said, in 2009, Applied Materials earnings to 50 billion. Difficult to predict the future development of solar PV industry, because there are many different levels of a number of variables, such as policy of the European market is also evolving, including policies and funding public debt, there are changes in the euro.</p>
<p>However, he believes that the European market is still an upward trend, this trend will continue in 2011, perhaps in the field of solar photovoltaics is a time a little slow, but will continue after the strong recovery.</p>
<p>Ke-Ping Ma said that among the overall electricity production by a total solar photovoltaic power generation of only 0.1%, a figure we can see through the potential is enormous, and He now hopes to provide a more economical solution is to exploit this potential market opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;China, more than the grid-scale solar power system development will bring huge opportunities for the company.&#8221; Ke-Ping Ma said that in the future China will cooperate with several companies, including National Grid, or the potential of large-scale power plants in China, plus a number of solar photovoltaic manufacturers electricity generation equipment.</p>
<p>Ke-Ping Ma in China, the number of competitors in the field of photovoltaic power generation can be increased in future, the current main rival is Europe. R &amp; D, the company hopes to research institutions more and more scientific cooperation, especially cooperation in research and development, primarily through the cooperative research and development center in Xi&#8217;an.</p>
<p>Built in 2009, Applied Materials, Xi&#8217;an solar energy technology R &amp; D center is the largest and most technologically advanced solar technology research and development center of non-governmental organizations.  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d800.htm">latitude d800 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d810.htm">latitude d810 battery</a></p>
<p>The installation costs can be reduced to 17-18 yuan</p>
<p>Applied Materials Asia-Pacific director of marketing and business development XIAO Jin-song said the company hopes to introduce Chinese companies to the state-owned energy to manufacture solar modules in a complete work closely with the industry chain upstream and downstream, reducing the overall cost of energy production from solar energy.</p>
<p>XIAO Jin-song said, under the same conditions, large thin film of 5.7 to 1.4 square meters per square meter than conventional batteries film battery used to reduce the number of mounting brackets, installation costs are lower, can save a few dollars dime, a 7 cents considerable RMB.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present the thin film solar power plant costs 1.5 U.S. dollars at the end or early next year to 1.2 million less, according to this calculation, the application of technology in China The cost of installation costs must be fully installed total cost 17-18 yuan, according to China Internet calls, 115 prices, installation costs can be reduced to 17-18 yuan less. &#8220;Xiao-Jin Song said.</p>
<p>Junfeng Li said last year China&#8217;s solar energy, only 200 megawatts, manufacturers, developers, integrators, combining three products to promote cost reduction of PV technologies is an important route and means.</p>
<p>&#8220;Solar energy now to reduce costs,&#8221; said Li Junfeng, Applied Materials&#8217; technology to China, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps5.htm">vgp-bps5</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps5a.htm">vgp-bps5a</a>  , the Chinese industry to the manufacturing equipment by reducing the cost of solar power really a cost advantage compete for the shortest possible time, this cooperation is not just the three companies hope more companies in the United States, through the mechanism of Sino-US cooperation in clean energy for their mutual benefit. &#8220;</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>The United States, &#8220;Technology Review&#8221; magazine has selected 10 each year could change the face of emerging technologies worldwide. This year&#8217;s list include the real-time search, socialization, television, green concrete, etc., some technologies could &#8220;Buds Lotus fair&#8221; as &#8220;dual antibody effect,&#8221; etc., has become another technology the spirit of industry in the popular vocabulary, such as cloud computing. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-vostro-1400.htm">Vostro 1400 battery</a>  , In all cases, these technologies will be in the World 2010 &#8220;, stirring a pool of spring water&#8221;, is scheduled to make our lives healthier and more beautiful.</p>
<p>New generation of photovoltaic energy &#8211; with the nanoparticles to improve the efficiency of solar energy</p>
<p>In 1995, Kailikaqie Boer completed her undergraduate degree in physics, decided to enter into a stagnant zones: the solar cells. 2006 became a post-doctoral Kaqieboer was a major discovery, pushing rates higher in the manufacture of thin film photovoltaic solar cell door. This upgrade can make solar power with fossil fuels in the game in a more competitive edge. Kaqieboer is now the Australian national team of University Research of an ion.</p>
<p>general use of amorphous silicon thin film solar cell manufacturing or cadmium telluride, and the more conventional and more expensive thick silicon solar cells compared to lower costs. Obviously, the efficiency of thin film solar cells also lower, because if the thickness of a battery than the wavelength of light is also launched in brief, the light is absorbed and converted into more difficult . Therefore, only a few microns thick film battery can not absorb a number of short wavelengths in the near infrared. Thus, the battery photoelectric conversion film only 8% to 12%, while the general rate crystalline silicon solar cell conversion can reach 14% to 19%. To generate more electricity will need to create a larger device, which greatly limits the application of solar technology.</p>
<p>When the metal surface by the light of the electronic stimulation,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-b120.htm">inspiron b120 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-b130.htm">inspiron b130 battery</a>, it will form a plasma oscillation. In traditional manufacturing silicon solar cells, many people have made use of plasma effects, to ensure that the battery is more efficient, but this person used to create a stack of thin layers. Kaqieboer discovered that it has filed a thin film solar cell surface of silver nanoparticles, and will not be totally reflective surface like a mirror of direct exposure to light. On the contrary, the plasma formed on the surface of the particle away from photons, so that these photons will be reflected back and forth inside the battery of the film to facilitate the absorption of light of length longwave.</p>
<p>cells Kaqieboer test equipment photoelectric conversion efficiency of thin film solar treaty is about 30% higher. If nanoparticles can Kaqieboer its large scale manufacturing of thin film technology and integrated, it could alter the balance of the solar cell technology, solar energy instead of traditional fossil fuels to accelerate the pace of energy . thin film solar cells can not only gain more market share (currently, its market share of 30%), while accelerating the development of photovoltaic industry.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, in the manufacture of thin film solar cells, cadmium telluride gradually replace silicon. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">vgp-bps11</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">vgp-bpl11</a> , However, Te is the rare element, experts worry about its supply might not meet demand. In this regard, silicon is more dominant.</p>
<p>Companies are now bent on Kaqieboer branch &#8220;olive&#8221;. However, as Kaqieboer before the commercialization of technology, to better improve it. Meanwhile, Australia&#8217;s Swinburne University of Technology researchers are also working with the industry giant, the largest manufacturers of silicon solar cells Suntech Power Co., Ltd. of China to develop their plasma thin film solar technology manufacturing cells, allegedly, society solar plasma cells should be marketed in four years.</p>

Kunming Trade, Ltd. know as a mountain, the company launched the service in Japan lead-acid <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk">battery</a> active agent can waste batteries over 12V lead-acid &#8220;Revival&#8221;, using the time to 1.5 times that origin. Although the maintenance of the new battery is to extend the battery life of 2-3 times to achieve a circular economy, reduce resource consumption and environmental pollution.</p>
<p>It is reported that the use of lead-acid batteries, the discharge process produce lead sulfate crystals, these crystals slowly attached to the plate electrodes, stacked thick and can eventually lead electrode conductivity Ershi accumulators. Such as the Director General on behalf of the company Kun Shan described the use of lead-acid battery repair the active agent can be decomposed effectively lead sulfate crystals and electrodes form a protective film to protect the electrode plates of lead sulfate crystals can not easily be attached to electrodes as no damage to the waste lead-acid batteries to extend life. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-vostro-1400.htm">Vostro 1400 battery</a></p>
<p>It is understood that the main city of Kunming has already registered more than 400,000 electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, one for each year, each year in the province of Yunnan Electric cars car battery scrap and scrap about 100 million. Dai-kun told reporters in the calculations: a 48V battery electric vehicles typically cost 600-800 dollars if the batteries back to business, up only about 50 yuan of subsidy. If the active agent to reach the repair of the battery just 100 yuan, but life can be extended to 1-1.5 times the original, so that consumers can save up to 70% of the cost.</p>
<p>Lead-acid battery repair agent is active in March 2009 from Japan to Shanghai. This year, in March, as a mountain Trade Co., Ltd. to become the technology of the agent of Yunnan. The introduction of this technology will greatly improve the use of Kunming recycling of scrap batteries, extend battery life and reduce the number of batteries.</p>
<p>Currently the company is a province-wide &#8220;recruiting&#8221; prepared to technology to all counties in Yunnan, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d430.htm">latitude d430 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d500.htm">latitude d500 battery</a> , and unleashed a battery recycling waste &#8220;technology revolution.&#8221; When asked about the operation of the project, Dai-kun in the project hope to create entrepreneurs hit the projects &#8220;Gold,&#8221; directed auto repair, computer printing supplies market, the market for electronic products.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>To many people, both actors have to play for Mac and PC, start a dialogue funny &#8220;Get a Mac ad campaign&#8221; is almost synonymous with Apple commercials, jokes and rich ideas developed for them to gain many fans. Last month,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-vostro-1400.htm">Vostro 1400 battery</a>  ,  has played in this series of ads &#8220;Mac&#8221; actor Justin Long in an interview that he had received the message, the campaign may be over.</p>
<p>Today, that prediction has finally become a reality. Apple has removed the official website of &#8220;Get a Mac&#8221; ad campaign series of the page and replace it with a new advertising campaign entitled &#8220;Why you&#8217;ll love a Mac&#8221; (why you fall in love with Mac), listed on page five main reasons: better equipment, better software, better OS, better support and compatibility. Now, even manually type the Get a Mac serial before the address of the page will automatically jump to &#8220;Why you love a Mac &#8220;program to promote the page.<br />
Apple Get a Mac campaign ad has been for many years, the last of an ad launched last year in late October, the theme of &#8220;welcome&#8221; Windows 7 Release. Although the new &#8220;Why you&#8217;ll love a Mac&#8221; TV ads advertising program has not yet published, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-9400.htm">inspiron 9400 battery</a> , has been a huge success for the previous generation of Apple should continue its projects and television advertising. The last six months Even if no new TV ad for the Mac release, but Apple has been introducing new iPhone TV ads, has recently begun to announce the update of IPAD.</p>
