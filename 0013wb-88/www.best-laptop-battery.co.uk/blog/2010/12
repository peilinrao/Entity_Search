                    <div class="entry-content"><p>According to media reports, the Spanish government recently released a new Royal Decree (RoyalDecreto), installation of photovoltaic systems will limit the maximum number of hours subsidized, triggering criticism of the industry.</p>
<p> Surprisingly, the Spanish cabinet is controlled through the last decade a huge accumulated deficit of the new tariff law. Deficits included increased power costs and the difference between electricity prices.</p>
<p> One of the measures is to reduce the deficit limit of photovoltaic power generation system, the maximum number of hours subsidized. Under the new bill Royal (RD) 14/2010, from December 23 onwards, the number of hours subsidized photovoltaic solar radiation depends on the extent and location of climate zones.</p>
<p> The bill under RD314/2006 bill will be divided into five different Spanish regions. Therefore, for a fixed installation of photovoltaic systems, to accept the maximum number of hours FiT subsidies from 1230 hours to 1750 hours per year, depending on the region where the PV system. Compensate for differences in such areas will come into effect in 2014. Between now and 2013, registered under the Act in RD661/2007 all PV systems, that is installed after the end of September 2007 all the solar system, the uniform time limit for the subsidy of 1250 hours.</p>
<p> Through this bill, the government expects to 2011,2012, and 2013, annual energy savings of seven hundred and forty million euros of PV subsidies. As compensation, these plants will have the right to the future more than three years of FiT subsidies &#8211; that is, subsidies from the age of 25 years to 28 years.</p>
<p> New legislation has given rise to the Spanish renewable energy sector harsh repercussions. Renewable energy producers organizations APPA (Asociaciónde Productoresde Energías Renovables) criticism: &#8220;The government will destroy the behavior of thousands of private investors. &#8221; Solar Energy Entrepreneurs Association AEF (AsociaciónEmpresarialFotovoltaica) worried that the power of the retrospective operation Bill will not help the Spanish in the financial markets to attract more investment.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>This is not just about six months ago forced him to step back and diseases. Steve Jobs was so severe wasting disease, eventually had a liver transplant. Just a decade ago, almost everyone that the cause of its co-founder Steve Jobs at Apple (Apple) has embarked on the road to ruin. Silicon Valley and Wall Street have concluded that they had no chance with the future of technology.</p>
<p>However, to the beginning of this year, Apple is already reborn. Before the press conference in January, even by his own demanding standards Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s expectations of the outside world is the extraordinary extent.</p>
<p>Critics always derogatory tone about Steve Jobs created a &#8220;reality distortion field&#8221;: He lets the audience be convinced, it seems that in the hands of other vendors have not yet formed a perfect Apple technology has been applied. In order to excite consumers to buy their own do not know if really need the desire of electronic products, crucial to dispel their doubts, and Jobs have long been recognized as a master of this art form.</p>
<p>In the iPad few months before the release, this latest technology breakthrough Apple product speculation after another. It is rumored touch-screen computer without a keyboard, or even comparable to the iPod in 2001 and 2007 the impact of iPhone. The conference in January, to bring Taiwan iPad Jobs did not let people down.</p>
<p>For F · Scott Fitzgerald (F. Scott Fitzgerald) widely circulated quote (Act II no American lives), there is no more resolute than this refuted. When Jobs first made headlines, even more than the current Mark Zuckerberg (Mark Zuckerberg) still young. Highly sought after as early as before the nerds, because the popularity of personal computers (PC) to play a key role, as well as Apple&#8217;s successful listing on Wall Street (at the time Jobs was only 25 years old), Steve Jobs became the first technology a rock star.</p>
<p>Now, three decades later, Steve Jobs became the turn of the century in shaping the world of a great tribute to the U.S. West Coast is one of several big tech companies. His old rival Bill Gates (Bill Gates) is perhaps even more wealthy, but the cause of the peak period in the Gates, by virtue of its monopoly in the PC software can be said that Gates&#8217;s influence Biqiaobusi greater. But Gates has left the stage, the rest of his life and wealth to devote to charity. Now, Jobs is the focus of attention.</p>
<p>Over the years, Microsoft&#8217;s all in the fight against Apple, no one won iPad than the impact of the great success. Nearly a decade ago, Bill Gates himself had also developed a tablet computer, but need to use a pen to write on the screen, and uses the same interface with the PC, the product is not much demand driven.</p>
<p>iPad is entirely different. iPhone continues the iPad the screen as well as for the specific task of multi-purpose lightweight &#8220;application&#8221; of innovation, not on behalf of a computer mouse and no Windows in the future. Cheap Internet sales have been hit.</p>
<p>Not all experts are welcome to this digital future. Online store sales through the manipulation of the application procedures, and rules for the development of these applications, Apple&#8217;s control of the New Kingdom is more than Microsoft&#8217;s control of the PC.</p>
<p>Critics, this is the dark side of perfectionism Jobs. Apple in good faith rely on the new ideas are likely to be stifled. Google has an ally (Google) points to the opposite of Apple. Google to open web-based smart phone set up their own software model.</p>
<p>However, for now, those worries is still very much a hypothesis, many consumers are very happy to buy Steve Jobs selling elegant, easy to use digital products. Jobs can make consumers uncertain economic situation, possessed a premium line to buy Apple products a camel. This ability, and even won the competition regimes.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley financier Roger McNamee (Roger McNamee), said: &#8220;Steve is the last of a great creator. He&#8217;s unusual in that, when the chief executive of the United States are trying to cut other spending and downsizing, He was in a vacuum to create new employment and economic activities. &#8220;McNamee mimic Apple recently re-Palm, but failed.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s touch screen product complexity, far more than tinker with Steve Jobs in a garage out of the primary products. Jobs in California at the northern outskirts of their parents home, and Steve Wozniak (Steve Wozniak) circuit board assembly with a first personal computer. Work out a set of rough wooden box &#8211; this is an optional accessory.</p>
<p>Start at the beginning, there is no indication that Jobs can achieve success today. He dropped out from college, there is no formal engineering background, has just returned from a trip in India. He is together with Wozniak found a way to love them into electronic products to start-ups.</p>
<p>Venture capitalist Michael Moritz (Michael Moritz) in the &#8220;return to the kingdom&#8221; (Return to the Little Kingdom) wrote that Steve Jobs on the pursuit of spirituality results in a very long period of time, shoes or soap mean nothing to him &#8211; it made working with him were very painful. Zen Buddhist teachings in his life plays a central role, so that the risk of pancreatic cancer, he has refused to accept the conventional treatment for some time, trying to Buddhism advocates a &#8220;spiritual force&#8221; to overcome the disease.</p>
<p>Less than 10 years later, Apple hired a more experienced manager to manage this growing business, in a power struggle, the 30-year-old Steve Jobs chose to leave the company he founded. However, in 1997, Apple acquired the struggling second company run by Steve Jobs NeXT, not in the past year, Steve Jobs will once again control the apple.</p>
<p>Jobs iPad is becoming more and more perfect the pinnacle of his career. Shoudi Xia had a lot of people in his will that he described as a tough foreman, only understand the art of possibilities, rather than long-term vision. This means constantly moving forward, rather than relying on the success of past profits &#8211; even such a star product iPod.</p>
<p>Software designer Autodesk (Autodesk) CEO Carl Bass (Carl Bass), said: &#8220;Other companies may try to extend the life of iPod product line, but Apple will say, &#8216;No, there is a better technology. &#8216;CEOs are not all brave, but Steve is definitely such a person. &#8220;Autodesk is one of iPad application developers.</p>
<p>Within the Apple, Steve Jobs has in the design and development of the final decision. Apple declined to be named a former executive said: &#8220;You have to let a person like your product. He is the user, but also the marketing department.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jobs near obsession with attention to detail. Jobs leaving an assistant this year, said the owner of the Apple icon in a program will never forget the appearance of defects, even more than the degree of concern the program bug. &#8220;We met to discuss the world&#8217;s most fantastic product, but he would stare at the meeting that icon.&#8221; This person said.</p>
<p>This complex is also a perfectionist every time Steve Jobs is widely anticipated public appearance in the performance thoroughly. Every play, he would have every aspect of the exercise. One other CEO Steve Jobs shared the stage has been released with Apple products. He recalls, he was brought in the middle of rehearsal Taiwan Jobs, Jobs disrupted attention, and he and the staff brought him to power have been condemned by a meal Jobs.</p>
<p>This led to Apple every misstep is particularly of concern. This year&#8217;s iPhone 4 loop antenna as flawed, more easily dropped. Products have long advocated this sophisticated and technical content of the flame greatly Jobs and defend vigorously, claiming that other smart phones have similar problems. But in the end, an apple or to the fashion conscious users who provide a buffer for free mobile phone sets, a temporary solution to this problem; later in charge of the project engineers have quietly leave.</p>
<p>According to a person with their work, said the growth of the business with Apple, Jobs also changed the style. A former Apple employee, said: &#8220;More and more pragmatic elements.&#8221; With sales of more than 50 billion U.S. dollars, Apple has set his sights on the mass market.</p>
<p>Word &#8220;compromise&#8221; may be too strong, but more intense interest in this sense represents the repositioning of apple in the world. Today, mass market retailers have also started selling iPad, which are high-end retailers and Apple stores the image tune.</p>
<p>A new stage in life, Steve Jobs is no longer a loser. May, driven by the iPad selling, Apple has finally exceeded the market value of Microsoft, the world&#8217;s most valuable technology company. Other companies also are looking at Apple, Jobs has taken some force does not look past the competition means consistent with its style. For example, after realizing that the threat of Facebook, Apple iTunes users for the launch of a similar social networking platform for Ping. For haughty as the year that Steve Jobs, it is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>In addition, in the face once allies &#8211; Google, Steve Jobs demonstrated a contemptuous attitude. He will be powered by Google Android operating system, and 7-inch screen tablet PC called the &#8220;useless, unless accompanied by sandpaper, so that users of Ground fingers.&#8221; Although some speculated that Apple may have introduced a similar-size tablet PC instead.</p>
<p>Jobs is also the concern of regulatory agencies have not encountered before. This year, expressed concern about the anti-monopoly agency, Jobs made a concession, no longer mandatory for developers to use Apple&#8217;s software development applications, or prohibiting the use of rival Adobe&#8217;s technology. However, it seems there is any other move &#8211; to prevent developers turn to mobile phones using the Android platform development and application. One industry executive said: &#8220;They have a little humility more than ever before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Jobs is still set up a formidable rival standard. McNamee said: &#8220;At present, they do not have natural enemies. Even if Apple introduced a dishwasher, people will go to buy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple CEO has served as the first Pepsi (PepsiCo) CEO John Sculley (John Sculley) commented in his autobiography, was his ambition to get rid of Steve Jobs: &#8220;Jobs said Apple&#8217;s goal is to become a very good consumer products company. This is a fanatical plan. can not be treated as high-tech design and marketing of consumer products. &#8220;Today, everything has shown that Scully you are so wrong.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, Yingli Group and the Tianjin Municipal Government signed a cooperation agreement under which Yingli PV industry in Tianjin port base building, specific projects, including solar PV module packaging factory and bonded warehouse logistics base for the British interest in the area of Tianjin Tianjin Development create good conditions. It is reported that the project will be British interest in Tianjin in April 2011 under construction.</p>
<p>Investment Advisor in the release of &#8220;2010-2015 China Solar Photovoltaic Industry Investment Analysis and Forecast Report&#8221; that Yingli Group is the world&#8217;s leading manufacturers of solar PV modules, their overall competitiveness in recent years as the company is steady progress in the construction of vertical integration significantly enhanced. The Tianjin Binhai New Area, determined to build a low-carbon advanced manufacturing and environmental protection industry gathering area, so from the Tianjin area, the introduction of Yingli Group, settled in this enterprise, very much in line of the industrial structure of Binhai New Area location.</p>
<p>Investment Advisor in Senior Fellow Li Sheng-mao pointed out that Yingli Group has formed a Baoding headquarters and two production bases in Haikou, the PV plant and the company bonded warehousing distribution logistics base in Tianjin is in fact its headquarters in Baoding base support. Including Yingli PV modules, including the major domestic manufacturers of most products to be exported to foreign countries, especially the European market, while the PV modules relatively bulky, so the domestic exports of PV components businesses mostly rely on maritime transport. Yingli reason for the layout of the previous production bases in Haikou, the important point is that the sea is a port city, the export photovoltaic module product relatively easy.</p>
<p>Baoding Yingli headquarters base in the other hand, the current British interest group here is still the main production base, but not the port city of Baoding, so the PV module exports must first be transported to the land of Baoding port city along the Bohai Bay and then shipped export, logistics costs are relatively high. Once the base is completed Yingli Tianjin port, the comparison can first crystalline silicon solar cell light transport from Baoding to Tianjin, and then packaged into PV modules in Tianjin, exported to foreign countries by sea, the operation process is very helpful Baoding Yingli base to enhance the competitiveness of this Part.</p>
<p>Li Sheng-mao that the British interest to reach a cooperation agreement with Tianjin, the two sides for the future, paving the way for deeper cooperation. PV module package from intrinsically labor-intensive industry, so its not in line with Tianjin Binhai New Area, the industrial structure of orientation; In addition, the PV modules encapsulated in the entire PV industry chain is the lowest average rate of profit the plate, the industry&#8217;s tax contribution to the local economy is very limited. So in the long run, not very likely to meet in Tianjin Yingli components only package base.</p>
<p>Investment Advisor in the Research Director Zhang Yan Lin pointed out that the next step can Yingli Group&#8217;s R &amp; D headquarters moved to Tianjin, which is more conducive to the development of enterprises. As compared with the Baoding and Tianjin is the first-tier cities, research institutes more Talents in relatively strong, while the photovoltaic industry is a technology-intensive industries, if the British interest will be moved to R &amp; D headquarters in Tianjin, will be very conducive to attracting PV industry professionals to join and enhance R &amp; D capabilities</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) super-lethal, can cause harm to the 100 kinds of plants, but it also has great places: embedded lithium battery can be stored after the ten-fold increase.</p>
<p> Foreign companies, according to reports, the University of Maryland researchers have found the tobacco mosaic virus and battery technologies nanorods way together, and quite good results. Prior to that scientists can only applied to the cell surface of rod-like virus. The virus was chosen because of its size and shape of the ideal electrode structure, can be self-replicating, self-assembly, and can and metal bonding, without any adhesive.</p>
<p> Electrode surface area of the battery storage capacity is critical, the virus can automatically increase the electrode surface area, charge the battery carrying ten times higher than ordinary batteries. That makes the phone a tenfold increase of the lithium battery, Apple&#8217;s MacBook Air could stand 10 months, charged only once a year, Amazon Kindle, smartphone talk time can be increased to one week.</p>
<p> From another perspective, with this technique, the same in the case of battery capacity can be reduced ten times the volume, so that designers can use this cell to develop a variety of interesting gadgets.</p>
<p> If this technology can be commercial promotion, then, means that the tobacco growers can finally do something good for society, people&#8217;s understanding of mobile technology may also have changed dramatically.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Yu Feng came today to tell me, you can go to Jiangsu to communicate with our entrepreneurs to talk about the Internet, I thought it was a very simple and informal exchanges, so I did not prepare too much, did not think this is a formal occasions, so I just thought for a moment in the end the following talk about? Today I would like to have such a chance, and talk about the two main aspects, one is the current status and trends of the Internet, and I also like this in the past 10 years from the development of Sina&#8217;s point of view, some of our own experience, and share about doing business experience, particularly experience of Internet companies do.<br />
First, I want to talk about the Internet such an industry, I would like to present a lot of entrepreneurs, many of the guests are supposed to be Internet users, and remember that we just do the Internet 10 years ago, when only 15 million Internet users in China today Internet users reached 400 million 5 million, that is, through 10 years of efforts, the number of Internet users in China increased almost 30 times. Another trend from the Internet is concerned, we remember 10 years ago are using narrowband Internet access, 99.9% of today&#8217;s users are in broadband above, while China has nearly half of Internet users through the wireless, mobile devices in the Internet.<br />
So what we said, wireless Internet, which is very alarming figures, which also explains why China, which over the past decade the internet has such a big development. Internet in the end has changed us? First, it changed the way we access information, means of communication between people, we are all familiar with in the past in the past 10 years we have experienced a portal, through a search, through the social networking sites, different products, different company to the different services we provide. These companies, these products give us a big change is that a majority of the entire Chinese people access to information, communication between people, the way of fundamental changes being very deep. The second change, I think the Internet brings a new way of public opinion.<br />
Many people know that the Chinese Internet sector, I think in the past 3,4 years, the fastest growing inside the two industries, one is the online game, one is online video. Network game, in fact represents a means through the Internet the way the game actually represents a very simple and very cheap form of entertainment such consumption. So, online video is also a very simple, very cheap a consumer, or even a free entertainment consumption, which over the past few years, Internet users in China Ye Hao, Ye Hao users time, a lot of it comes from two pieces of business growth, today the people playing online games in China, people who watch the video close to 3 million.<br />
The third change I think the Internet is largely caused by trade, a new trading platform we have a new way to trade, we say that e-commerce. We review the past 10 years, China&#8217;s Internet changes, we found that, in fact, the first 10 years of China&#8217;s Internet, is a truly developed information, and information. Another aspect is fun, it should be said that the Chinese Internet industries in the past, the driving force is primarily concerned with these two, profit model is from the advertising and games. Today we talk about Internet advertising in 2010 will reach 40 billion yuan this figure.<br />
From the online game industry, speaking from the case, is more than 1 billion industrial-scale figures. Development of the Internet and other large countries do not like where we are infotainment first, but our e-commerce development is relatively lagging behind. A very important reason is that China is the early development of the Internet, e-commerce requires some infrastructure, some basic system is not perfect, the number of our businesses online is also very small, so in our 10 years of the early developments, although There are many e-commerce sites to see there, there are a lot of e-commerce transactions, but e-commerce as an industry, as a whole, then the size of a business and not a very big development.<br />
So, over the past two years, and I think such a market environment, undergoing profound changes, first of all we are talking about a lot of e-business infrastructure, regardless of distribution or just the credit system is gradually being established, which gradually improved , and our growing number of Internet companies, more companies to trade through the site.<br />
The third block is very important that we speak of e-commerce, a large extent, depends on his size is the size of our users, because in fact one of the advantages of e-commerce is big business scale, the Chinese Internet early time, only one million people, of course, a lot of e-commerce sites is difficult to scale and big business, and today there are over 400 million people online, we believe that the outbreak of e-commerce has already begun.<br />
We may be more concerned about a number is in the end how many people now through e-commerce website, online buying behavior, it should be at the end, this figure has reached 100 million 5 million people each year in the future, we believe 50 % growth, so we say, 10 years before the Internet if it is information-driven entertainment-based industries, then the next 10 years is the e-commerce, the Internet industry to promote the development of our greatest motivation, e-commerce to promote industrial development Power comes from two, one is more the development of e-commerce site has never been more transactions, bringing more employment opportunities, e-commerce itself also needs to have a precise demand for ads, I hope other sites to bring them more business, more users, more traffic, and he in turn would promote what we call the online marketing, online advertising in the huge development.<br />
We say that a lot of vertical sites, many new sites, including our search engine for the development of such an outbreak of e-commerce, then I believe that online advertising in the future there will be a great improvement. This is one of our simple to review the development of Internet in China with some of the current situation. So let&#8217;s take a look at the future, then, how the development of the Internet trends.<br />
First, we talk about the past, the development of the entire network, then start a portal, and later search, I believe this is a very important point, we all know there is a FACEBOOK site, bringing a new Internet trend is the social network, we say Portal is an integrated platform for the mass of words, search is an information platform to find the words, FACEBOOK is the relationship between a network of friends, I believe that the development of the Internet will play a very big, fundamental change in the trend.<br />
Another trend is the rapid development of mobile Internet. Mobile Internet, we all know that the development of mobile Internet subscribers reached over 200 million in the next 5 years which I believe will be more than PC Internet Mobile Internet, more people in the mobile Internet, it is very great opportunities. Social networking and mobile Internet represents the future of the combination of a direction. Many of our companies are also continuing efforts in this direction.<br />
Many people ask me, micro-Fair in the past year so the fire inside, we are actually little more than a year, from zero to 5 million users, I am sure many of Sina&#8217;s users not only more Sina microblogging users, the reason it became such an explosive products, in a sense he conform to the trend of the Internet, he has a social function, the other is a mobile Internet applications, today 45% of the users is through mobile phones, mobile devices through our micro-Bo, with China Mobile Internet population continues to increase, the proportion rising, we micro-blog application in the mobile Internet, there will be a great potential, which is part of my talk about the Internet.<br />
From Sina&#8217;s point of view, I simply want to share with you the development experience of a company like Sina, may in many ways I do not want to talk too much experience on the Internet in more operations from the company point of view, from a business point of view for how we look. What kind of mentality we are, what kind of strategy, a good strategy to develop our company.<br />
Sina process may be developed, through the course of about ten years, we have experienced a lot, we may experience in this market a most Internet companies, we have experienced from the earliest, we call start time to various stages of development of the Internet has gone through many times up and down the capital market, there are several experience can share with a means that if an enterprise to become a high-tech enterprise, we must take the forefront in technology and products, able to firmly grasp the direction of technology, this is a necessary point.<br />
Another, from the perspective of enterprise development, I think a business should be able to continue growing, then, first of all must be able to catch a very good, have a keen eye to seize the market and the needs of users, very, timely, forward to do investment in these areas and develop inside. Sina Sina&#8217;s becoming, he began as a portal of sites, the reason has now become an influential platform for us to cling to the Chinese market is the so-called media development opportunities because the birth of the Internet in China since the day China has just begun the development of traditional media, the Internet of course has a very powerful platform technology and product advantages of the traditional media do not have.<br />
We at this time, firmly in the grasp of such a link in the media, we are very proud to be the first time, others did not wake up in time to fight the Chinese Sina most influential media integration platform, which is We are caught in the history of great opportunity, so have the advantage of the development of the first wave of Sina and the opportunity to seize the opportunity we have today is very good that we caught the trend of social networking and mobile Internet, on the future of the Internet There is a very good development.<br />
We have also launched a microblogging time such a product, so that such products firmly grasp the trend of development of the Internet and user trends, let us once again in such a social media platform to find opportunities to find the lead, I believe that in this respect We will continue to expand the lead, both as a very powerful portal, there is a very powerful integration of social media such a super-media platforms.<br />
Second, I think that as enterprise development, we must firmly focus on the development of our so-called core competencies. Sina history possible, we have done on many, many other businesses, have done many, many other attempts, but we do well, we have the most influential in the market, doing the leading all around our core competitive force that we in the network&#8217;s core media business, our super-media platform, we do portal Sina very successful, very successful blog platforms we do, we do the same to be the leading micro-Bo, and if we can not focus on a core competitive force for development, often many of our lessons are very painful, this is my second point would like to share the experience.<br />
Third, I think there is such a process, we still have to focus on core competencies continue to improve this core competence, in the process to seek a breakthrough.<br />
What does that mean, today we talk about not just the words of microblogging is a new social media platform, more importantly, the mobile Internet and social networking we are talking about a development of great new Internet platform, hosted in the above opportunities not simply be a media opportunity, the more it will push us a month ago that we Sina microblogging has been open to the development of the whole society, want them to develop applications in the above, can be a game applications can also be e-commerce applications.<br />
We told our developers to share what is it? Our customers, our client relationships, and our information flow, we packed out these three things, with the development of our developers, we hope to play our Sina microblogging cause such an open platform, that we Apple stores are now familiar with such a platform, in the above can carry hundreds of thousands, millions of applications.<br />
That is, we hope to build such a microblogging platform of such a chain, so that we produce a chain of more and better content and other applications, the users of our services, enabling us to create a want a set of open, shared future of the Internet, because of the time, I&#8217;ve not much to say, would welcome the opportunity, the time in the future to continue to share with you our experience in this area, thank you.</p>
