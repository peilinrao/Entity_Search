                    <div class="entry-content"><p>The emergence of new energy vehicle development is inseparable from lithium batteries, combined with the government, even behind the energy savings reduce emissions so that the short-term lithium batteries stocks put in the medium formerly known. From political point of view China&#8217;s overall current economy to low carbon, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-fk890.htm">fk890</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gk479.htm">gk479 </a>，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-nf343.htm">nf343</a> ,or will become a new market segment of excitement.</p>
<p>Saved energy industry to reduce emissions, the government, even behind the explosive growth is expected to</p>
<p>Last year in late November, the Chinese government announced that by 2020 carbon emissions per unit of GDP compared to 2005 levels would be reduced by 40% to 50%, while in December of the same year in the Danish capital of Copenhagen climate summit failed to reach an effective liaison forces agreement, but because of global warming caused by emissions reduction requirements is the common aspiration of all men , future efforts to reduce emissions will not be frustrated because of the climate conference weakened. International obligations, the Chinese government always keeps his word, the line must be fruit in 2010 will be the horn into the era of the first year savings to low-carbon, new energy is a major component economy with low emissions of carbon can be expected over the next decade, the new energy industry of the explosive growth of China will occur, the industry in the economic structure of China will also occupy a strategic position more important. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps2</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> , </span><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps2a</span></a> </p>
<p>Essential for development of new energy vehicles lithium batteries</p>
<p>The industry&#8217;s current energy means new in many areas, we recommend investors to focus on industrial lithium batteries. Lithium batteries are new materials is an important base materials for electric vehicle battery, and new energy vehicles is the state&#8217;s strategic and emerging industries, vigorously support the development of national strategic industry . According to the State Council promulgated the &#8220;planning to revitalize the auto industry to adapt,&#8221; In 2011, China will form a new energy Qijuchanneng 500,000. Sales of passenger cars energy represented about 5% of total sales. Planning, developing experts predict that by 2012, hybrid cars in China will reach 50 million vehicles, pure electric vehicles to maintain a volume will reach 10 million units. In 2020, hybrid cars in China will reach 18 million euros, pure electric vehicles farms reach 4 million. Therefore, one can imagine the future of new energy vehicles in what would mark the beginning of dramatic growth, which will bring new energy automotive battery infinite space for development. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-satellite-m55.htm">satellite m55 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-tecra-a3.htm">tecra a3 battery</a> </p>

<p>It should be noted that according to the experts say, the planning of a smart grid include the vehicle of the new energy pricing issues central planning. Therefore, we can expect this year, new energy vehicles will have a range of dividend policies. From disk to the lithium-related stocks in mid-January started a wave of Shenglang the main market, although for a period of slump, shares of these companies have also created some adjustments, but later in the week, the stock has become active again. Taking into account the hours shorter in February to March, the economy with low emissions of carbon will certainly get more attention, which will greatly boost the stock price up, and related policies should be introduced, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1012.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">apple a1012</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> , </span><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1022.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">apple a1022</span></a> , so there is some of the share price of the Company&#8217;s next wave of Shenglang main market, investors can pay attention because choosing the right moment to intervene and usher in the new master Shenglang Quotes.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>According to foreign media reports, the safety testing of U.S. certification and Underwriters Laboratories (UnderwritersLaboratories, called UL) plans to launch a series of electric vehicle batteries new specifications. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-hd438.htm">hd438</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-kd186.htm">kd186</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-y9943.htm">y9943</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-fk890.htm">fk890</a></p>
<p>With interest growing population in electric vehicles, the U. S. Underwriters Laboratories said in a statement, &#8220;The new specification will help people avoid hazards such as fire, the batteries of electric vehicles to improve overall security.&#8221; In other words, Underwriters Laboratories hopes to create a set of specifications batteries for electric vehicles in the future the government will require battery manufacturers to comply with the Underwriters Laboratories certification. Laboratory has been the norm for this series named for the first time Project No. 2580.</p>
<p>Underwriters Laboratories, said: &#8220;Before becoming the standard of standards, these requirements will be accepted worldwide for a comprehensive review of the commission. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps2</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> , </span><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps2a</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> ,</span>Global Standards Technical Committee by consumers, government regulators, manufacturers, and representatives of other agencies that can provide a product with reliable security standards. &#8220;According to international consulting firm Oliver &#8211; Wyman estimates that in the next ten years the world will be added 1000000-5000000 hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. Underwriters Laboratories, said that the rapid development of electric vehicles has also brought the fire electric shock and other security risks. Obviously, Underwriters Laboratories hope that the U.S. government &#8217;s request to the United States has sold the battery electric vehicle certified. However, even if the U.S. government has not agreed to do so, the Underwriters Laboratories certification may still come from the electric vehicle market, play a part. In addition to developing new standards for car batteries, the company also is tested for electric cars to other parts standards in force. &#8220;These parts include motors, connectors, and a battery charger. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-fru-92p1141.htm">fru 92p1141 battery</a> </p>
<p>Underwriters Laboratories says it protection against overloads for these components,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-satellite-m105.htm">satellite m105 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-satellite-m110.htm">satellite m110 battery</a> , impact, flammability and other tests. Ultimately, Underwriters Laboratories safety standard will help the electric car market towards normalization. Underwriters Laboratories is an independent product certification organization for safety, more than a century has been focused on product development and safety standards. Laboratory has evaluated over 19,000 products, original materials, and systems. Each year, there will be 20 billion UL Marks appearing on 72,000 companies in the world of manufactured products.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>According to news agency Reuters recently reported that the German Minister of Environment Norbert Loettgen proposed photovoltaic net off 15% of the reduction of subsidies to reduce the burden on electricity consumers. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-y9943.htm">y9943</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-fk890.htm">fk890</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gk479.htm">gk479 </a>，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-nf343.htm">nf343</a> ,Mitigation measures the government has supported two phases. Coincidentally, January 13, the French Department of Energy announced that the roof of solar panels for the subsidy rate for electricity for the compulsory acquisition in 2006 has been enacted and € 0.55 per kilowatt hour down 24%, to 0.42 euros and other categories of the system fundamentally unchanged. China International Capital Corporation analyst Also, the judge, Italy could follow Germany and France to cut subsidies. The industry is concerned, the tariff reduction initiatives, European PV, in a certain extent, China&#8217;s exports of solar modules to form bad.</p>
<p>Investment Advisor in the energy industry chief researcher Qian Jiang emphasized that from Spain, the European countries to reduce subsidies to the photovoltaic industry, the European PV market is facing the phasing out of the political situation government.</p>
<p>The beginning of the year 2009, Spain announced that the field of solar energy to reduce funding, the size of grants in 2009 was only 500 MW, the actual capacity of the year, the Spain directly from the 2511 MW in 2008 reduced to less than 200 MW. UPS fierce market of Spain and downs, so that the global PV industry, particularly China, are aware that not just rely on political support to survive, we can not wait for the government of grant higher subsidies for the price. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d420.htm">latitude d420 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d430.htm">latitude d430 battery</a></p>
<p>&#8220;What we need is that incentives in a stable long term, efforts by own photovoltaic industry to continually reduce costs until the final elimination of subsidies. Only in Thus, the PV industry really only hope. &#8221; Jiangsu business components of a photovoltaic device to the &#8220;Economic Information Daily, told reporters.</p>
<p>Now the world&#8217;s largest PV market, Germany, offers a substantial reduction in subsidy programs, which really makes the global industry, a high degree of tension and vigilance. Will repeat the mistakes of the Spanish PV market, has become the industry people to talk about hot topic in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;European countries including Germany, the changes in PV subsidy policy and political changes in Spain in early 2009 are not the same,&#8221; Jiang Qian to the &#8220;Economic Information Daily&#8221; Reporter in the cast to produce a report, &#8220;Germany, the current subsidy case solar energy was in 2008, an official read out by the House of Commons of countries finalized. The current annual acquisition costs of solar electricity from 2008 to annual reduction of 5%, down 8% annual variation 2009.2010, 2011, down 9%.</p>
<p>Great Wall Securities Analyst Zhou Tao as the new energy industry, the German PV feed-in tariff reduction, which aims to profit from the domestic photovoltaic industry space compressed. &#8220;Price adjustment before the German photovoltaic electricity € 0,43 / kWh, is relatively high, government subsidies under pressure, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">vgp-bps8</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm">vgp-bps8a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">vgp-bps11</a> ,while the German PV market is a continuing influx of new businesses moving. Germany is obviously thinking of this country PV market was overheated in some compress margins. Zhou Tao to the &#8220;Economic Information Daily, told reporters.</p>
<p>Europe is a major exporter of China component of the solar cell. Jiang Qian believed that Germany and other countries intend to reduce subsidies to solar energy will not be much impact on the global PV market, but may have an impact on Chinese manufacturers PV.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, more than half of domestic exports of concentrated photovoltaic products in Germany. While domestic firms to be in the new situation as far as possible to develop emerging market shares, the only way to reverse the adverse effects of cuts in subsidies to a minimum. &#8220;Jiang Qian to the&#8221; Economic Information Daily, told reporters.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Qian also said that optimism about the PV modules to China during the financial crisis led companies to develop their overall capacity for competition and control costs, &#8220;the components of the battery supply raw materials, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3191u-4brs.htm">pa3191u-4brs</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3284u-1brs.htm">pa3284u-1brs</a> &#8212; International silicon prices are falling, and has now dropped to $ 52 per kilogram. &#8220;Jiang Qian example.</p>
<p>White Rabbit, Jiangsu branch innovative energy [0.231.75%] Co., Ltd. mainly develops high-performance concentrating solar photovoltaic technology and product integration. January 24, Qian Yi, vice-president of the company told the &#8220;Economic Information Daily&#8221; Reporter: &#8220;The German solar feed in tariff reduction for future exports are likely to have some impact, but at the same time, our costs are lower and thus difficult to say has little impact. &#8220;</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>In the recent international meeting of China&#8217;s fourth Summit of the Forum on New Energy, Science and Technology Vice Minister Cao Jianlin stressed that scientific and technological support of the strategic role of new industries have become more more prominent, &#8220;Eleventh Five&#8221; Year of China in the new energy and renewable energy development access to numerous breakthroughs in key technologies, a series of demonstration projects aimed at promoting industrialization has accelerated the launch of new energy technologies and product applications,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-g5266.htm">g5266</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-hd438.htm">hd438</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-kd186.htm">kd186</a>, but the lack of R &amp; D investment, cost control, and insufficient penetration of social life, constraints still exist, the future of technology and development Industry There are also many obstacles.</p>
<p>Advances in demonstration projects to promote key technologies</p>
<p>Cao Jianlin pointed out that &#8220;Eleventh Five&#8221; Year of China in the emerging field of energy has been successfully mastered a number of key technologies of intellectual property rights to develop several independent sets of lines with current technology or potential China, the key equipment. In the field of wind energy, China has mastered 1 ~-3MW Dual-feed series VSCF wind turbine design techniques; 1.5 MW direct drive magnet permanent, wind technology has reached mass production, own design and development of the 1.5 ~ 2.0MW wind turbine blades, to achieve mass production of domestic machinery manufacturers. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl2.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">vgp-bpl2</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> ,</span><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps2</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> , </span><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps2a</span></a></p>
<p>In the generation of solar photovoltaic energy has been built the largest city of Yiwu International Trade 1.295MWp grid solar power plant, and allow production of electricity, completing a megawatt concentrating solar design power plants, in addition to multiple levels of desert 10MW grid-connected photovoltaic plant is under design construction. Independently developed advanced international level 250kW and 500 kW grid-connected photovoltaic plants, and reach the space to run.</p>
<p>It is said, in response to the financial crisis, Science and Technology, Ministry of Finance have jointly launched a series of demonstration projects and industrial expansion. Such as &#8220;10 City, 1000,&#8221; Electric Vehicle demonstration and application projects, plans to use four years, select the extension and application of a number of pilot cities, including pure electric vehicles , hybrid vehicles and fuel cell, including the 60,000 vehicles in clean energy. To promote the &#8220;Golden Sun&#8221; project, plans to use three years in some cities across the country to promote different types of demonstrations of production technologies and photovoltaic products. Demonstration project exceed the total size of 600MW, annual production will more than 1 billion kWh. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3535u-1brs.htm">pa3535u-1brs</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3591u-1brs.htm">pa3591u-1brs</a> ,Promoting the &#8220;City 10000 10&#8243; project has more than 20 cities across the country launched a pilot project to promote LED () lighting semiconductor, giving priority to applications in urban lighting lighting and landscaping, three years should promote the use of the ladder to reach 6 million.</p>
<p>Currently, the project was in full swing. In late 2009, nearly 30 billion yuan to subsidize the first batch of the central government funding has already been established.</p>
<p>Cao Jianlin said that the department develops a &#8220;Shier Wu&#8221; planning, new energy sources will continue to focus on development and areas of priority development. &#8220;Shier Wu&#8221; period, China will continue to increase its demonstration research into new energy technologies and development efforts to support and actively promote the new energy and electricity, from a technical level, to solve large-scale renewable energy grid problem bottleneck. Increase network intelligent search and development of key technologies and equipment investment will be a number of cities across the country to carry out demonstration projects. Will be based on the Nansha Islands, Paracel Islands, etc. practical requirements of the Navy of the border, develop sets of wind, solar, energy storage, desalination as one of life facilities and renewable technologies of the energy supply. Will be organized to implement the new rural energy projects in rural areas vigorously promote wind, solar, biomass use. Will also be organized ahead of geothermal energy, ocean energy and other renewable energy research on key technologies. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1012.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">apple a1012</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> , </span><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1022.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">apple a1022</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> , </span><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1060.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">apple a1060</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">  </span></p>
<p>Cost control, the rise of non-factors</p>
<p>New Energy National Energy Board, Deputy Director Shi Lishan, noted that currently the development of new energy industries, there are technical knowledge and management issues and challenges, there are some quick profit approach. He explained that in the new China&#8217;s energy and renewable energy sources and use of the technology of hydropower is relatively mature, but there is relocation, lack of advertising and so on. Wind energy in building a large base, the dominant model, wind electric field, it should also take into account small and medium-sized wind farms and offshore wind energy construction, there is an urgent need to address wind energy to run the contradictions unresolved. The cost of monitoring solar photovoltaic power generation to the forefront. Assign the project cost photovoltaic power generation because the two batteries, silicon materials, and other material factors, but also the installation, operation and not other material factors. The construction of some projects being more costs than material costs. Use of biomass energy should be addressed to electricity, transport, heating and other areas to promote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not only concerned about the signs, but also optimize the system, optimizing the building, otherwise the cost is difficult to get.&#8221; Aimed at the cost of feeding problems photovoltaic generation control, Shi Lishan, with particular emphasis on construction management through strengthening the building to increase the cost of space power generation control . <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/fujitsu-lifebook-t4020.htm">fujitsu lifebook t4020</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/fujitsu-fpcbp121.htm">fpcbp121</a></p>
<p>It is reported that in the power of 2006 China Solar Energy Photovoltaic electricity costs 4 yuan, and 2009 units of electricity have been reduced to 1 yuan, while the initial deadline for achieving this target by 2015. Meanwhile, the thin film solar cells generate electricity costs have dropped to less than 1 yuan. Even so, the production of photovoltaic electricity is still higher than conventional energy costs are high, subsidies are needed in the future to reduce the cost of limited scope.</p>
<p>Limited demand side applications must be encouraged</p>
<p>Cao Jianlin said that apart from R &amp; D investment, cost control and other issues, a new energy, renewable energy solutions for applications that also involved the question of how to infiltrate all aspects of life, changing production and lifestyles, is the new direction of energy consumption. &#8220;The solar, wind resources are thin (low energy density) should be more for the house and use live.&#8221; He said.</p>
<p>The development of housing construction, according to the Ministry of Science and Technology Promotion Center of the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of living built since 2006 to start building applications for the city demonstration renewable energy at the end of 2008 has been implemented for four approved 371 projects. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-btp-44a3.htm">btp-44a3</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-btp-58a1.htm">btp-58a1</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-btp-63d1.htm">btp-63d1</a>  ,These projects more than one type of technology, such as greater use of sunlight and heat applications, ground applications of heat pumps Source technologies mainly less complex.</p>
<p>This reporter has learned that in the construction of use of solar energy in 2009 to launch construction projects for public buildings, followed by industrial buildings, civil construction is still relatively low. At the same time, 21 applications for construction of the city demonstration of renewable energies and 38 rural counties of renewable energy demonstration through the approval of applications for construction, which will provide for the construction sector in China did not promote the use of large scale renewable energy deficiencies.</p>
<p>The official said: &#8220;Shier Wu&#8221; China will abide by the conditions of the building to enforce the use of renewable energy for heating, cooling, lighting, hot water and so on.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps8a</span></a><span style="font-family: 新宋体;"> , </span><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm"><span style="font-family: 新宋体;">sony vgp-bps11</span></a> , The top-down coercive measures that promote good energy saving building applications, but in terms of policy direction for the country should also be encouraged to increase the demand side of Pratt &amp; Whitney of the policy issued.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Science and Technology, held in Shanghai last week, a discussion session on the Internal Electric Vehicle Charging Station lot of controversy. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery</a></p>
<p>&#8220;No electricity costs several years, the battery on the wrong.&#8221; Participation of Experts suggested that in the fast charge 15-minute conditions, the damage of the battery is very serious. We may say, the technology battery is not mature enough charging stations will be a considerable degree of control in development.<br />
In October last year, passed the acceptance Caoxi charging stations in Shanghai is also the first charging station of China has been in business for more than three months. Electric Vehicle Charging Station this something new in this new industrial space to be opened before, is not it, there are still many small to cross the threshold? Reporter conducted field surveys. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gk479.htm">GK479</a>， <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-fk890.htm">FK890</a><br />
Taiwan&#8217;s First Electric Vehicle Charging Station &#8211; Shanghai Caoxi Electric Vehicle Charging Station is located in the Xuhui district Caoxi an area of 400 square meters, including four on tax-street parking, as well as five sub-station office spaces parking, that 9 parking spaces to meet different types of electric vehicle charging needs.</p>
<p>It is reported that Caoxi Electric Vehicle Charging Station temporarily open to the community of vehicles specifically for the electric buses such as roads 825 and Electrical Power Engineering vehicles, electric vehicles to provide services.</p>
<p>This reporter has seen the biggest difference with the traditional gas station is charging station the journey is self-service. Then, a good cable, and insert the smart card to car owners through an interactive interface to select depending on the load of vehicle owners to claim the amount, a total of &#8220;fully automatic&#8221;, &#8220;set time&#8221; and &#8220;will&#8221; three types of modes. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-pc764.htm">PC764</a>，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d620.htm">Latitude D620 battery</a></p>
<p>In addition, the owner may charge for time commitment, self-organized. According to reports, 825 Road &#8220;Battery &#8211; Capacitor&#8221; hybrid buses for each drive one kilometers consumes only 1.2 degrees, according to calculations of the night at half price every day, about 200 meters kilometers miles, energy expenditure less than one hundred dollars per day, considerably less than the normal buses incurred on the costs of diesel power.</p>
<p>Shanghai Electric Power Company, according to insiders, 825 Road, super capacitors and batteries in hybrid battery &#8211; capacitor &#8220;type vehicle, fully loaded, the maximum driving range of up to 300 km, a maximum speed of 80 to 100 kilometers. But since the battery problems in consistency in the 825 road car charging is completed, the mileage endurance of only 100 kilometers, and did not meet the original design goal of 300 kilometers.</p>
<p>Charge battery may be preempted</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, I think, although the majority of loading stations, but it is more suitable for electric vehicles of public transport operations and vehicle scale systems without power loading and unloading of a solution Not at all a few charging stations can be resolved. &#8220;Those concerned that the National Grid said the newspaper Shanghai Securities News. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">Sony VGP-BPS8</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm">Sony VGP-BPS8A</a> </p>
<p>Charging station more suitable for the use of objects such as large scale models of bus service, if the future of the private car of the country&#8217;s electricity charging stations rely on the case, the area of land would be very alarming. Electric cars for private users, the most convenient is the battery charge. Therefore, the short term, charging stand, cost and other factors affected the pile load capacity could be a step faster.</p>
<p>The National Grid has an inspection tour of Japan and electric vehicles in the U.S. market. In Tokyo, Japan currently has 87 charging stations, but around the buildings, the pile load bus, California, Stanford University, it is specially designed for electric vehicle recharging parking spaces, two spaces Parking for each between, there are lots of expenses.</p>
<p>In industry a bold prediction: the future is more popular than the loading station, a larger space for development is the battery charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charging more difficult to estimate the battery market. Buildings, residential areas, car parks and other places most convenient for the construction of the battery charge.&#8221; Experts agree. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-2bas.htm">PA3399U-2BAS</a>，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-1brs.htm">PA3399U-1BRS</a> </p>
<p>However, the national network and other utilities, to build a charging station, the load cell work must still be approved by the state departments concerned. &#8220;Currently, just who should invest in a station for recharging the battery and battery charging, the policy is not clear, in fact, which also requires access to the threshold of the industry, access policy and related specifications. &#8221;</p>
<p>Look forward to breakthroughs in battery technology</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a small piece of mobile phone battery can be used two days, while the cars every day, open, require much volume of the battery? China is currently the leading supplier of advanced technology yet. In this regard The market there is an empty place. &#8221; National Grid believes that the current national grid to cooperate with BYD, technology battery energy storage in the future wish to enjoy.</p>
<p>Vision for the future, if the energy stored in the battery inside can, to a high possibility of the use, will be able to reduce significantly the problem of power shortage in China. Meanwhile, the realization of decentralized electricity and reduce carbon emissions, use more clean energy, which is the national network, is the blueprint of best. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1045.htm">PowerBook G4 15 battery</a> </p>
<p>In Regulation of battery technology, the charging station may be able in the near future, a national trend has been Liaoyuan stars.</p>
<p>Our reporter was informed that Beijing intends to accelerate the construction of charging stations for electric cars. 2010 years, only to be built in Tianjin 5 charger Power Station. Working Report of the National Grid has revealed that at present the national grid in Shanghai, Tianjin and Xi&#8217;an, urban construction, the pilot electric car charging stations.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, Stanford University, Stanford, Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Yi Cui (YuCui) led the team has developed a stack of paper less than a month later, he led the same group of soldiers, the introduction of new &#8220;power clothes&#8221;, intended for people who have all the clothes in a power source, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery</a> ,may proceed at any time, anywhere recharge mobile electronic devices.<br />
And stack of paper is similar, the researchers use &#8220;ink carbon nanotube&#8221; fibers dip-dye clothing, it has the ability to take charge. When the clothes and can retain sufficient charge, it can be treated these coats to charge for laptops, with trousers for mobile phone charging and so on.</p>
<p>The same principles and Paper battery</p>
<p>This is actually an extension of the concept of the paper. December 7 last year, scientists from Stanford University in a report from, they have successfully coated with a layer of silver nano carbon materials of paper in a stack of &#8220;paper&#8221; will become a whole new light and efficient energy storage method. Help coating attached to the same characteristics of paper so that it attaches to the single carbon nanotube thin-walled film and silver nanowire. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gk479.htm">GK479</a>， <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-fk890.htm">FK890</a> , A preliminary study concluded that the use of nanowires made of silicon cells, the efficiency is now used for electrical appliances such as laptop lithium-ion batteries by 10 times.</p>
<p>&#8220;This type of battery for hybrid electronic devices, or providing energy. The use of such batteries, electronic devices become lighter, and longer, but one day may produce products of electronic paper. Battery weight and longevity is the power cars and trucks in the commercial development, a major obstacle. &#8220;Yi Cui said.</p>
<p>According to this method of storing energy through the fiber, and more portable electronic devices and portable electronic devices, you can use outside, the researchers also noted that some paper on super-capacitors can also be applied to all those who need the features of high instantaneous power consumption. University of California, Berkeley, chemistry professor Peidong Yang is expected that technology will soon be marketed. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">Sony VGP-BPS8</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm">Sony VGP-BPS8A</a></p>
<p>Solve the high cost is a priority</p>
<p>But for the future of this new type of battery, in particular, will replace the current battery, the Industry, there are different opinions. Harbin Institute of Technology College of Applied Chemistry, Department of Professor Sun Kening that the new document as a new concept of the battery cell, the use of the future is definitely yes. However, the newspaper ran the battery of the current methods of production point of view, the production of such paper batteries need a very high cost of production of nanotubes is not suitable for mass production, so its usefulness is limited. Among the reasons for the technology and others is not a substitute for extensive use of other types of batteries, it is impossible for market share in the short term.</p>
<p>Of course, this new battery for laptops, mobile phones, digital cameras and even cars are a perfect disc. For example, because plasticity, these batteries can even be in the shape of the door, with other batteries unmatched advantage. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-2bas.htm">PA3399U-2BAS</a>，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-1brs.htm">PA3399U-1BRS</a></p>
<p>Requirement for researchers is how efforts to reduce the cost of these batteries.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Major polysilicon solar cells in the world of commodities, even if China became the world&#8217;s largest producer of solar cells, but a long period of polycrystalline silicon heavily dependent on high cost imported from abroad, manufacturers of household solar cells to earn only modest processing fee. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery</a> ,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gd761.htm">gd761</a><br />
Recent years, with LDK Solar, Sichuan Xinguang a number of companies such as the introduction of foreign technology, have launched the polysilicon, self-sufficient rate of raw material polysilicon China has been improved. However, as technology and process control is not yet in place, costs of production of polysilicon in China of high energy consumption and has become the solar photovoltaic industry in China in the development of &#8216;a &#8220;flawed&#8221;, appears stronger step by step to maintain the polycrystalline silicon industry in China, facing the &#8220;destruction&#8221; of the dangerous.</p>
<p>Single-energy plant in Nanchang equals 1 / 4</p>
<p>In the current domestic production of polycrystalline silicon business to come from behind K LD LDK PV Silicon Technology Co., Ltd in the production of polycrystalline silicon, investment called &#8220;big ticket&#8221; items, the information already made public view, 1 .5 million tons of nominal capacity is currently the largest single plant capacity. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10a.htm">vgp-bps10a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9a.htm">vgp-bps9a</a></p>
<p>This major project is located in Xinyu City, Jiangxi Province, Jinan International Development and Science based photovoltaic technology, covers an area of 1.162 million square meters, annual production of 3,000 tonnes of five electronic online production of quality polysilicon comprising the popular use of international news &#8220;improved Siemens Law&#8221; producing polycrystalline silicon materials. Project in September 2007 began the construction of the second half of the production process in 2009.</p>
<p>The production of polycrystalline silicon with high energy consumption, including most of the power consumption. According to Jiangxi Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau Savi produce 15,000 tons of polysilicon project approved, the project is put into production, annual consumption of diesel is about 209,000 tons, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-2brs.htm">pa3399u-2brs</a> , the annual two months of 3.2 billion kWh of electricity, only the consumption power plant is equivalent to the total electricity consumption in Nanchang 1 / 4 &#8217;s, does not plant the living energy, the production of consumption total energy per kilogram of polysilicon to 213 kWh.</p>
<p>Energy giant as a number of SMEs in the production of polycrystalline silicon on the higher energy consumption. Shijiazhuang Dongming Silicon Technology Co., Ltd. in December last year, the production company of polysilicon, the annual production of 200 tonnes. According to the office of the society, said Zhang Xin, director of the investment firm is a company of leather, mainly to see the industry make money, they buy a company of Luoyang, Henan province Siemens France improved technology, began in July last year, day and night to catch up with advances in less than half of production. Currently, companies producing polysilicon 18 tons per month, the electricity consumption of 3.5 million yuan to 0.5 yuan per kilowatt per month, 7 million kWh of consumption, production and energy consumption per kilogram of polysilicon to 389 kWh.</p>
<p>All energy recovery two to three years</p>
<p>Such high energy consumption, means that the industry should be restricted to prohibit the development of development? In fact, the same high energy-consuming industries and China&#8217;s iron and steel, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r52.htm">thinkpad r52 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-t40-series.htm">thinkpad t40 battery</a> ,electrolytic aluminum, has compared the two industries, the production of polycrystalline silicon for the energy consumption per unit output value is lower than steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>CPPCC member and president of Nanchang University School of weeks photovoltaic Lang has been specifically measured, despite the production of energy consumption per ton of polysilicon as steel and aluminum, but much higher than the price of polysilicon per tonne of steel and electrolytic aluminum, even if the price of polysilicon from a peak of U.S. $ 400 per kilogram has fallen to its current level of about $ 70 U.S., consumption energy per unit of polysilicon output value is always less than steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>From polycrystalline silicon for solar photovoltaic modules produce electricity, the power consumption of the whole process, according to control Suntech Power Co., Ltd., and Professor Zhou Lang has calculated that the average light conditions in our region, the installation of one megawatt solar power system V, the annual production of approximately 120 million kilowatt hours, and 1 watt of silicon solar cell integrated power system production facility 3 kwh under the terms of megawatts of solar photovoltaic power generation system was installed to produce three million kwh, only 2.5 years can be recovered balance its own power. As each level of the difference in energy companies, domestic solar polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic power generation system, the average payback period for installation of energy between two to three years. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1079.htm">a1079</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1148.htm">a1148</a>, With low energy consumption, the payback period will be further reduced.</p>
<p>Currently, domestic production of solar modules around the life of 25 years, as calculated to produce the solar component in achieving the production of recovered energy, almost need to consume more electricity can power about 22 years, and there are no emissions. In fact, even 25 years later, the efficiency of solar module production there about 25 years to 80% may still be used for a long period of time. ZHOU Lang said: &#8220;Our country has the will of the international community in 2020 emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of GDP in 2005 dropped by 40% compared to -45%, non-accounts of the fossil energy for the proportion of primary energy consumption has reached about 15%. Among these, after the wind electricity from nuclear power after the general development of the production of photovoltaic solar energy will open at spring development. &#8221;</p>
<p>Saving Imperative</p>
<p>Although the view recovery cycle, production of polycrystalline silicon solar cell module of electricity consumed can be recovered in 2023. However, China&#8217;s production of polycrystalline silicon consumption per unit of energy is much higher than the world advanced level, which is also our polysilicon production costs are much higher than the world advanced level, once the world&#8217;s highest level for the seven main groups of price reductions abroad collective, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/fujitsu-fpcbp121.htm">fpcbp121</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/fujitsu-fpcbp121ap.htm">fpcbp121ap</a>,our existing production of polysilicon companies will face huge losses, the industry polysilicon China, there will be danger of destruction.</p>
<p>Zhou Lang explained that at present abroad, seven manufacturers of major producers of polysilicon overall consumption of energy per kilogram of polysilicon -150 kWh 120 kWh between the two, and our average level of business manufacture of polysilicon over 200 kWh, and many small factories and even the level of more than 300 billion kwh. Production costs of polysilicon, the energy is precisely the most important, China&#8217;s production status of polysilicon high energy consumption, resulting in production of polycrystalline silicon internal costs are much higher than in the world advanced level.</p>
<p>Photoelectric Technology Co., Ltd. Sun, general manager of Jiangxi Peng said, at present, the international market price of U.S. $ 60 on the polysilicon -70 U.S. dollars, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-btp-58a1.htm">btp-58a1</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-btp-63d1.htm">btp-63d1</a> ,local businesses to produce a pound of silicon cost polycrystalline -50 U.S. $ 40 dollars more in between, overseas and seven major polysilicon cost of manufacturing firms U.S. $ 20 -30 dollars. Once the seven major groups of overseas prices lower collective enterprises producing polycrystalline silicon in China will face bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In addition, the polysilicon industry, are capital-intensive industries, a huge investment, higher rates of corporate assets and liabilities. For LDK Solar LDK Solar Co., Ltd. silicon technology projects a yearly production of 15,000 tonnes of polysilicon, for example, total investment of over 10.0 billion euros, with investment of just over 100 million yuan in environmental protection. From the journalist who interviewed a number of companies photovoltaic comprehensive estimates of the polycrystalline silicon industry assets-liabilities ratio averaged over 60%, once a bankrupt company, the banks will bear the losses enormous loan.</p>
<p>For the high energy of the polycrystalline silicon industry in China, the industry there is a crisis of the status quo, Zhou Long, Peng professionals in these proposals, the state should take measures to encourage businesses, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm"> vgp-bps2</a> ,research institutes, such as the production of polysilicon and reduce the consumption of a joint scientific research and encourage enterprises from sales revenue to extract a greater proportion of R &amp; D spending, set production and reducing consumption of technical and technological improvements.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>In January 2010, the French National Academy of Sciences study (Varennes, PQ) has developed iron-based catalyst for fuel cells. Sources said that precious metals and rare metals (platinum) over iron-based catalyst application will significantly reduce the cost of fuel cell business. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-1520.htm">inspiron 1520 battery</a>,In comparison with other catalysts, iron-based catalyst for catalytic activity is relatively low. Because the iron based catalyst for fuel cell reactions, redox active sites is relatively low. Researchers around the development of a microporous carbon supported iron to improve the catalytic activity of iron-based catalyst. Iron and graphite micro-lamellar voids pyridine nitrogen functional groups within the ligand binding. The researchers found that the burden of carbon, o-phenanthroline and a mixture of acetic acid from the iron ball milling, followed by argon gas and ammonia in the catalytic cracking Thermal iron may increase the density of active sites. Currently, the research team to study further the sustainability of the technology so it can be used in the automobile business in fuel cells.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">vgp-bpl11</a></p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>The state adopted a policy of subsidizing the consumption of new energy vehicles, the automotive business, consumers and industry should take the necessary steps in this direction. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell.htm"><strong>dell laptop battery</strong></a> ,Other countries have already adopted a similar policy of subsidies that China should draw lessons.</p>
<p>Political However, Automotive Engineering and Development Research Institute of Tsinghua University Vice President Song Jian of the State adopted similar to the opportunity to express a different view. Singing from the point of fairness, &#8220;said state subsidies should be shown to the poorest and most vulnerable, who are the same in all countries. If the government has provided grants to buy a racing car, and that the person riding a bicycle that does not mean that we can say: &#8220;I am even more energy, reduce emissions efficiently, it should be funded for us. &#8221; <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gd761.htm">gd761</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-y9943.htm">y9943</a></p>
<p>This year, the hot topic of new energy vehicles. Some people think that new energy vehicles in China are no longer negotiable, mainly because the government has not provided consumers with subsidies and tax benefits. In this regard, my opinion is that the subsidies in China, not strength, and abroad differ considerably. If the only vehicle of government subsidies to large scale, there is blame to the people.</p>
<p>Saved energy abatement of public opinion is not a problem, but in real life is difficult to justify, it does not work, because people do not drive vulnerable groups. Because the tax breaks for energy conservation to reduce emissions is not feasible, may give way to that of non-emission energy of the excise tax on vehicles or levy taxes on energy so not only can increase revenue, but also grants to the poorest population.</p>
<p>The new energy vehicles in foreign countries may also be considered a hot spot. It is noteworthy that the level of economic development is very important in Western countries,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">vgp bps2</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">vgp bpl11</a>  the gap between GDP and China&#8217;s formidable, even if someone has already introduced many measures, we would not be able to go quickly. In addition, the level of development of independent brands in China have not yet the degree of correspondence.</p>
<p>Another point to note is that if direct subsidies to consumers, this part of the money directly into a joint venture or an outside pocket, because subsidies to powerful groups, not only unfair subsidies and grants large abroad.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even subsidies to domestic firms, it can not be sustained. In fact, companies also know that our country can be a long-term subsidies. China is now a production year 12 million vehicles, cars are estimated at half the subsidies still have half the 60 billion, but this grant was also assessed on the vehicle before 10000, did not exerted significant effects.</p>
<p>For grants to really play a role in theory, reduce costs will enable all parties to accept, but now the cost of production of motor vehicles to reduce the space is not significant. For vehicles with new energy certainly use a motor, coupled with the battery in it, the price will certainly increase. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3420u-1brs.htm">pa3420u-1brs</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3450u-1brs.htm">pa3450u-1brs</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3478u-1brs.htm">pa3478u-1brs</a> Now many car plants in developing new energy reasons why vehicles there is no enthusiasm, because they will settle the account. Some claimed to do the project for new energy vehicles, are the mouth and shouted many in the state money. As to how their money after the sample, it is their own objects. Abroad, new energy vehicles is actually called, tens of thousands of vehicles per year of production, not with the tens of millions of cars to classic cars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Song also believes that the energy emission saving is not necessarily based on new energy vehicles. He said that the energy emission of plural economy, not just cars perspective. Engine cars manufactured in China with foreign countries in relation to energy production even at the same time, may take more fuel 10% to 20%. In terms of energy savings, as the engine design slightly to improve some, then can take energy saving of 10% ~ 20%, not increasing the number of costs on the other hand the automatic transmission cars are more and more as long as the use of AMG, the automatic transmission can be compared to a yield of 20% ~ 25%. This question should not spend a penny, on the contrary, the AMG is also compared with AT in price by 20% to 30%, and worthy of national extension.</p>
<p>In addition, some industry sources, with subsidies lead consumer behavior is not consumers affordable vehicles, but consumer behavior driven by stimulating the development of the automotive industry. Secondly, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1280.htm">apple a1280 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1281.htm">apple a1281 battery</a>  with regard to whether it is from independent brands, the brand is still a net importer of joint-venture brands recorded sales market boom in the economic environment of China to promote, so when the trend Cold economy, promote domestic demand is that the government should consider. Finally, by far the most important, the emergence of new energy vehicles may be an historic opportunity for the automotive industry in China, but amplified to a high degree of country, national and even all mankind based on the extension and new energy vehicles is contributing to protecting the global environment. This perspective, if we can play any of the reality effect of any measure that did not overstate</p>

<p>The end of 2005, an opportunity, an exhibition of Inner Mongolia Yitai Group to a new concept &#8211; represent 98% of terrestrial matter to a certain degree of purification of silicon cells made from silicon, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">vgp bps11</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">vgp bps8</a> silicon cells to produce electricity and energy is clean, infinite. August 2006 by the National Development and Reform Commission agreed that the Group of Inner Mongolia Yitai invested 21.2174 million yuan in the city of Ordos Kang Bashi area plan control area under the topography of the region, a simple structure, sufficient sunlight, the construction of China&#8217;s first large (250 kW) concentrator solar photovoltaic demonstration power plant. In October 2007, the project completed successfully and generate electricity. In the project, installing the latest technology, the standard four times cells 150w photovoltaic solar concentrator 200 kW, traditional dishes 5kw PV cells, construction of the 35kV Booster Station 1. After the generation step up after the voltage level 35kV access Kang Bashi New District Industrial Park 35kV urban low-voltage lines. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a></p>
<p>Yitai solar project generating electricity for the first time reached a condenser and a follow-up to both the model and this track concentrator photovoltaic technology for electricity generation has been applied in the current conditions of small scale traditional plants Flat Panel PV power saving of 25% silicon material through the timely follow sooner or later, a 25% increase in production capacity, thereby reducing the cost of photovoltaic electricity production by 50%. At the same time, under normal circumstances, a conventional photovoltaic cells in a living off of electricity that is produced during the manufacture of this piece of photovoltaic cells for electricity consumption by 3 to 4 times, while the project on several occasions of using light-volt condenser system this ratio rose to over 10 times.</p>
<p>September 9, 2009, the first U.S. solar companies (FirstSolar) signed a memorandum of understanding with the city of Ordos, and decided in the Ordos Desert Kubuqi Hangjinqi creating a world where the largest solar power plant . The data published in the years FirstSolar, the future of the world&#8217;s largest database of solar covers an area of 64 square kilometers, the required investment of five billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars, the estimated production level 2 billion watts (2000MW), the equivalent of two coal-fired power plants in China, it will give three million households lighting needs. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/compaq-evo-n410c.htm">compaq evo n410c battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/compaq-evo-n400.htm">compaq evo n400 battery</a> After project completion, the size of the plant that currently operates the largest solar power plant 30 times larger, 10 years later, China&#8217;s three million households can take advantage of new sources of clean energy</p>
