                    <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Likely to replace the existing capacitors double-layer&#8221; &#8211; Li-ion capacitor developers say in unison, showing the performance of these devices and the prospects of self-confidence.  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">dell inspiron 6400 battery</a> Although the development of lithium-ion capacitor that happening, but in 2005, and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. has announced the adoption of multi-benzene (Polyacene) to develop the potential of technology as an opportunity to further accelerate the pace of development. Introduced in 2008, decided manufacturers of mass production, from 2010 to 2011 the market will be fully launched.</p>
<p>Electric double layer capacitor market size is currently 40 billion yen. Japan Hiedge Institute research firm, chairman of the East Valley, Nishida said it was &#8220;a conservative estimate,&#8221; he predicted in 2020 lithium-ion capacitors will be developed to 80 million yen from the market.</p>
<p>A growing number of practical applications allow the market to begin</p>
<p>The adoption of lithium-ion capacitor of the negative lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and electric double layer capacitor of the cathode combined structure,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery</a> which is higher than the double-layer capacitors with electrical performance.</p>
<p>At present, capacitor-lithium ion began to be applied to real activity. Fukushima Prefecture, Japan natural gas field offshore marine mining equipment (rigs) the introduction of production equipment, wind energy, with 21 units with facilities to small scale wind power, l installation using lithium-ion capacitor module. Although the platform drilling has ceased to work in the future will be available for the storage of carbon dioxide in the sea in experimental applications. To ensure the maintenance of electrical drilling platforms, platforms drilling established wind farms in Japan small scale power Zephyr &#8220;Air Dolphin&#8221; and the capacitor module. A year after commissioning, in June 2008 became officially operational. Zephyr Ryosuke Ito, president of the lithium-ion capacitor is extremely optimistic about the prospects for development &#8220;in terms of wind energy, lithium-ion capacitor is an excellent device . Hope that universal coverage &#8220;, note 1).</p>
<p>Located in the windmill and the capacitor between the inverter module, capable of absorbing a substantial change in the size of the wind energy capacity to play a buffer role in electricity generation, although stopping sudden can also be accumulated by the use of capacitors in the power module, so that inverter input voltage is maintained. In addition, generally below the inverter losses, the wind, when a small production capacity can not save electricity through temporarily stored in a capacitor, you can get the electrical storage. Instead, in the production of more than nominal inverter capacity (1kW) of production capacity of wind power, through the interior of capacitor for electricity storage,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">sony vgp-bps11 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">Sony VGP-BPL11 Battery</a> you can avoid wasting electricity. Capacitor module by Zephyr with JM Energy development policy. &#8220;When I was frightened about 10 between the performance of unbalanced cell battery voltage, but in recent years of operation of a show that works very stable&#8221; (Zephyr Corporation Ito).</p>
<p>Can also be used for street lighting</p>
<p>There are other examples. Japan light L (L-kougen) has developed a set of LED lighting, solar panels and lithium-ion capacitor in one of the streets, experimenting with the company&#8217;s products were Japan, the prefecture Miyazaki to introduce a pilot project. &#8220;In the long term maintenance free, and very light, can be installed on the use of lights&#8221; (L-kougen President Kiyose Keita).</p>
<p>Testing of products with an average of 0.6 W of power, driving two 1W LED lighting. While the streets around there is no light in the darkness, so if the total power, then, enough for overnight use. While discussing the feasibility of using nickel-hydride batteries in metal, but to react to changes in production capacity, the control module will become very complicated. Therefore, the use of electricity that can easily adapt to change, and lithium high energy density capacitor ion. The battery cell using capacitors and Technologies (ACT) developed by &#8220;Premlis&#8221; electrostatic capacitance of the capacitor cell battery 5000F Note 2).</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>China North Vehicle Research of major projects of the National Institute of 863 electric vehicles Power Battery Testing Center is the primary test vehicle battery power and authority certification for the state the means of control quality to guide the development of the basic battery of tests, but also at home and abroad to carry out the relevant communication window. At present, China&#8217;s battery power the vehicle in the development and production, what problems still exist?  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a>  Their technical standards? To solve these problems, this reporter recently interviewed Prince, director of the Center for the winter.<br />
&#8220;China Automotive News&#8221; At present, China&#8217;s battery power the vehicle certification and control, how are we going?<br />
Prince of Winter: Since 2006, the National Directorate of Vehicle Standards announces new energy battery test in effect, the power of the electric vehicle battery before testing the ad should be mandatory. Initially, only a very small output of the battery through certification, is currently about 30% of the production of the product has reached a certain standard. China North Vehicle Research Institute Power Battery Testing Center is the primary test vehicle battery power and authority certification, we passed by the State based on a car battery, battery modules and national standards Project 863 large energy batteries and super capacitors testing standards and all sorts of individual cells, modules, battery performance and safety tests and full tests.<br />
Development of new energy vehicles for the safety of battery power and life cycle proposed higher requirements, certification and testing, as the battery from the battery company in the industry threshold of new energy, but this does not mean that by sensing the battery can be well applied to electrical car.  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">sony vgp-bps11 battery</a> Because electric vehicles are electric (EV), fuel and electricity and gas, hybrid electric (HEV, PHEV) and the model for many other performance requirements of the battery varies greatly needed features power to the vehicle battery to assess specific pairing.<br />
For the power of the battery of safety tests of performance include acupuncture, overloading, excessive discharge, squeeze, drop, high temperature, short circuit test items, etc. 7. Adopted into a single cell basis, we also test the security module will consist of five cells in the module series of battery tests. Due to cost constraints, at present there are very few companies test the safety of the battery. Testing a cost of &#8220;battery pack of 100 thousand to 50 million, while the entire group of test vehicles electric bus battery pack often requires the cost of several million dollars, we now have the batteries used in power real safety data of the electric vehicle, and compared with test data there will be some deviations.<br />
&#8220;China Automotive News&#8221; In the testing and certification, you think how the safety performance of batteries power of China? What problems still exist?<br />
Prince of Winter: On the security side, China&#8217;s leading power vehicle overloading of the battery over-discharge problem is not serious, but more problematic is the short-circuit, acupuncture and squeeze. While the battery life for companies looking to invest substantial funding, but most production of the batteries in these three cases is difficult to ensure. Although acupuncture, short circuit, the compression is borderline,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">dell inspiron 6400 battery</a>  but not underestimate the potential danger. In case of spillage, accident, the implementation of the rescue process, the presence of the battery power of these problems often cause secondary damage.<br />
This year, the state-led industrial development of new energy, promote the advancement of electric vehicle technology, however, electric vehicles launched around the relatively more blind. Vehicle battery charge and discharge process is very complicated and complex, motor cars and the environment, often found in the wind, frost, rain, snow and other inclement weather, the battery safety, consistency, stability , demanding. Battery companies not only need to have a strong R &amp; D team, but also a large number of trial experiments, to produce a driving force to meet the application requirements. Currently, Chinese companies generally have no experience of producing batteries supply, equipment manufacturing, sensors, connectors, positive and negative material, divide not advanced enough, there will be a great risk production blind.<br />
&#8220;China Automotive News&#8221;: the last two years, China&#8217;s battery production vehicle supply and sales, technical level and scale of development in what way?<br />
Prince of winter: the use of point of view, China Ni-MH battery that lithium batteries perform better security, but the lithium battery a higher energy density and longevity. Currently, domestic companies producing lithium batteries more, especially lithium iron phosphate faster than any other battery development.  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4812a.htm">hp f4812a battery</a> There are many dynamic models of electric vehicles, different models of batteries, has raised one of the requirements of different applications.<br />
Scale production and marketing standpoint, my car battery power are in the basic R &amp; D, pilot phase, which has yet to reach mass production, it is not widely used in electric vehicles, short term, businesses in the battery pack is unlikely to achieve profitability.<br />
&#8220;China Automotive News&#8221; with the advanced international level, the gap between the battery power of China is reflected in what areas?<br />
Prince of Winter: First, the foreign power batteries using automated production methods, while internal essentially manual and semi-automatics are not likely capabilities of mass production, level of accuracy is not high . Degree of commercialization of view, China has the battery power can be sold, while foreign sales of pre-existing motive power free. From the product structure, the foreign accent on the overall design and evaluation battery, including battery heat, energy management, standardization of connectors. In China, the focus of battery companies still in the material of the battery. In addition, foreign battery parameters of development, standardization, serialization functionality significantly,   <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1280.htm">apple a1280 battery</a> while the size of domestic products, the range varied from a heterogeneous disorder.<br />
Second, China is relatively backward battery production facilities of electricity, many companies focus on the subject, ignoring the improvements of the manufacturing equipment. At present, China will depend mainly on the production of batteries and equipment imports expensive, which is our development of battery power vehicle is very unfavorable power batteries in mass production It should be equipment for advanced automation, the focus of advanced research.<br />
Third, most independent research firms in China and battery development, funding is limited, can not solve the fundamental problems of battery technology is difficult to advance further. Lack of adequate communication between businesses, all want to know the circumstances of other people do not want to talk about their own experiences, there is widespread low-level study of the phenomenon of repetition. We must learn from Japan, to create a dynamic alliance in battery technology to promote technological development common to spend money on the razor&#8217;s edge.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>1, the tendency to move</p>
<p><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a> </p>
<p>Internet matures has clearly begun to affect people&#8217;s lives. Development of the Internet and computers notebook is simply coincides with the birth. Notepad technological change and jumped on the applicability of laptops have a stronger impulse. In the mobile environment in the laptop and most tend to be practical and pragmatic.</p>
<p>    Post-PC era, no longer troubled by the user is visible and tangible &#8220;hardware&#8221; products, but rather how to understand and better and faster access to information. Consequently, an increasing number of mobile computing tools focus on the critical need to address are: How easy and quick exchange of information, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">dell inspiron 6400 battery</a>  how to put these devices to connect more easily to the Internet, they can be as much time to maintain the original mobile characteristic of power without the constraints?</p>
<p>2, the source of the laptop computer</p>
<p>Slim, high capacity, long life, are the outstanding characteristics of lithium batteries. For this reason, lithium-ion, he quickly replaced nickel-metal hydride, batteries nickel cadmium role as laptops and other portable devices optimized for life. However, recent times, constantly being exposed exploding laptop battery makes notebook battery time and again pushed into a cusp</p>
<p>As of October 27, 2006, the overall number of Sony battery recalls again expanded to nearly eight million euros. Of these, 4.2 million Dell and Apple 1.8 million, 830,000 Toshiba, Lenovo 526,000, 287,000, Fujitsu, Hitachi, 16000.<br />
    Sony even greater concern is that this trend seems to recall continues to spread. Golden Week, in addition to Lenovo, the company has officially announced the recall of four numbers,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">sony vgp-bps8 battery</a>  there were companies such as Acer and Sony have also stated that he has been contacted to determine whether to recall their products.<br />
     For portable batteries overheating and even fire triggered the reason Sony has admitted that the existence of gaps in the manufacturing process. Short-circuit the battery, for producing a small amount of metal debris remain in the cell. Sony Rick Clancy, a spokesman said that in recent years Sony has been an increase in security measures, efforts to reduce scrap metal, but they can not be eliminated.<br />
However, it is a laptop hidden built-in battery-known risks, charger or a laptop computer for various reasons, the instant of lithium batteries provide high voltage / high current leading to a serious overload, such as conversion the load voltage 220V to 20V or even lower when there is a high charging current generation, the battery must be in the circuit moves to cut the charging current, but because part of the lithium battery charging voltage,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1245.htm">apple a1245 battery</a> over current design of protective functions is low, which may lead to the battery protection IC is damaged, so as to protect the laptop battery so that the function of burning the motherboard is damaged, fire and so on and laptop given. Another laptop computers manufactured by working long hours on the high-temperature battery laptop has some influence! Because heat is the enemy of a battery, use of laptops would produce a certain temperature, which is very harmful for the battery.</p>
<p>3, a Sri Lankan passenger heel Grand &#8211; who dragged their hind legs?</p>
<p>Laptop battery on the market today can be divided into five categories: original laptop battery, the third brand of replacement batteries for the battery cell, an auxiliary battery, the battery of mobile external<br />
In general, the best quality laptop original battery. If in earlier times through a series of tests, the more likely a problem, of course, original price batteries for laptops is relatively high.<br />
    <br />
Third replacement batteries party known as the OEM battery. In the cell production foundry both the strict replacement of some giant cells, but also black refurbished recycling of batteries used to do. The low price of these batteries are sometimes staggering. And because the poor quality of the battery problems are caused by many of the laptop on fire.</p>
<p>Zhongguancun, part of the electronics market, business laptop is very hot, and even sell cable network, and selling CDs to sell its reporters &#8220;service battery.&#8221; The &#8220;Battery Service&#8221; type of variety : Consumers may choose to &#8220;change the&#8221; kernel, or buying a battery, external battery, original batteries, used batteries, etc.;<br />
    Among them, the laptop batteries &#8220;kernel&#8221;, the most prosperous business. The introduction to business park in the heart of this change is to take the laptop battery actually open, which replaces the rechargeable battery. Merchants &#8220;For the kernel is very simple, very safe, for many people.&#8221; Some reporters. However, a journalist from the professional and technical information received, on the contrary &#8220;to the battery base is the most precarious.  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4812a.htm">hp f4812a battery</a> According to introduction, &#8220;to heart&#8221; very difficult to achieve after the laptop battery power requirements of laptops offers configuration, there is a big security risk. So, why people have chosen also for basic services?<br />
    The lack of attention to maintenance of batteries and battery problems inherent quality of these factors, a number of laptops are used for some time, the aging of the battery, wait times have significantly decreased or even unusable. At this stage, the replacement of their notebook batteries have become consumers faced with numerous problems. While consumers certainly comes to mind first is to buy original batteries, but a common brand of batteries original equipment often Yi Yuan in 2000, many consumers are left to think of a way Release.<br />
    Currently, royalties on the market for basic standards for a &#8220;core&#8221; (rechargeable battery) required about 50 yuan, according to a maximum of 9 &#8220;core&#8221; calculation, each battery for a laptop &#8221; nucleus &#8220;is also up 450 yuan, and basically the price could be further to the&#8221; weak party talks. &#8220;As the name inexpensive, and many cases of&#8221; maintenance center &#8220;on the cover, which makes many consumers rush to this, the search costs of basic services efficient, there are ulterior motive.<br />
    To compete and sell so-called &#8220;original battery&#8221; Merchant said: &#8220;These&#8221; kernel &#8220;very&#8221; black heart &#8220;, many tenants are said to be&#8221; deposit &#8220;is that you bring to secretly &#8220;for the base. A merchant said: &#8220;Some merchants allow the user to see a good nucleus&#8221;, because it is defective, or even just for 12 &#8216;Base&#8217;. more &#8216;intelligent&#8217; link &#8216;core&#8217; does not change, but the old battery with high voltage-activated, as long as the user looks at the time of delivery can be used, they can receive money in A. But can take to use if they explode, so that the user or to buy us &#8220;safe home.&#8221;<br />
Confirmation of this statement, the declarant to provide basic services to merchants for questioning, and some businesses were once tense, anxious to explain to basic services, no problem, saying that &#8220;to do, but we Insured not deceive you.<br />
For basic services, can not be ensured, then the so-called &#8220;original battery&#8221; battery no problem? Or insider Inter-Business exposes so-called &#8220;original battery&#8221; especially the old laptop to &#8220;pull&#8221; down and rebuilt after the (such as &#8220;change the&#8221; kernel, etc.), and &#8220;foundry cell &#8220;&#8221; secondary battery &#8220;on or impossible to determine its origin in.</p>
<p>The external laptop battery is the new new thing. Small size, easy to carry. Using some time to enjoy the movable feast. External battery of the biggest advantages is its security, external laptop battery does not need help could be a load independent charging does not occur when the load caused by the excessive burning of the laptop. Also use a portable interface to supply external power supply, laptop computers are generally designed to protect the external interface of the power circuit, which makes the overall security has been greatly improved, also because it is external, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gd761.htm">dell gd761 battery</a>  the laptop to work long hours, the heat generated by an external battery that has no side effects, thus reducing significantly the incidence of failures and problems. Another external battery prices are much lower than the original battery, and has been a growing number of consumers.</p>
<p>Abstract:<br />
Regarding the five types of batteries we use the following form to make a simple comparison (the highest five star).<br />
Battery Original OEM battery used battery cell battery and external battery<br />
Price High Low Low Low<br />
Safety in High Low Low<br />
Sustainability in the Low Low Low High<br />
The failure rate is low, medium and high<br />
Buy index ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>5 types of cells, change the battery cell and secondary battery index buy the minimum laptop beloved, not defending the consumer to buy.<br />
OEM Battery is the uneven level of participation time, too many variables and does not advise consumers to buy.<br />
Original battery quality is better, but the price is high, if sufficient money to consumers, is a better choice.<br />
External quality of the battery is good, price is not high, self-employment is also useful to my friends, is the best choice.</p>

<p>Yong-Kang Sha</p>
<p>New energy vehicles in China has brought a wave of enthusiasm, making mobile communications and mobile has had a huge convenience of audio-visual aspects of lithium batteries to become the competition&#8217;s most popular and one of the concerns.</p>
<p>However, when more people living on the odometer,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gk479.htm">dell gk479 battery</a> the battery life and even how to deal with waste batteries and so their brains, a very important fundamental problem seems to have been overlooked, is &#8211; simply secure?</p>
<p>March 1978, served in the pharmacy of the United States Exxon (engineer) invented Stanley Weitinghanmu lithium, probably does not think the next 30 years the invention of science and technology to human life in a change enormous, and lithium, the lightest metal known the natural world has become more intimate and human together.</p>
<p>At that time, the sulfur compounds Weitinghanmu to the titanium anode, lithium metal as the anode in the first prototype of a global lithium battery.</p>
<p>It works by lithium-ion battery <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10.htm">sony vgp-bps10 battery</a>  positive and negative cycle formed between the current movement to achieve load and discharge process. Therefore, lithium batteries, also known as lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>A few decades thanks to constant improvements to the anode and cathode materials, smaller and more energy density of lithium batteries, as well as lower prices were made, the advent of mobile phones, to further promote its miniaturization, lightweight, and later universal access to micro-electronic products, such as music players, today, is even regarded as a wave of strong electric cars inevitable choice.</p>
<p>Things, however, in recent years, mobile phones and the explosion of the music player&#8217;s battery is common, it seems that once again sounded the alarm &#8211; which brings convenience to people&#8217;s lives are not imaginary seem less secure. The relaxation of the manufacturer&#8217;s quality control it? R &amp; D are elements of the battery changed? Or the attention of people and underestimated the power of secure storage?</p>
<p>A mobile phone battery contains lithium metal, lithium less than 5 g, a mini-electric cars more original, if rechargeable batteries 30kwh above, the battery contains lithium metal is about 50 kg or more,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4809a.htm">hp f4809a battery</a> cell phone batteries will cause the explosion is still afraid of a group of mini-cars in case the battery if it happens, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>China has held in lithium batteries installed in electric vehicles, parking in the garage during the night suddenly caught fire and the vehicle burned and the situation a few months ago, there was the phenomenon of spontaneous combustion of hybrid buses, but the discovery and elimination of too early, before major damage is not brewing. Obviously, the planning is the battery, the liability of the electric vehicle industry.</p>
<p>Indeed, the lithium there is an explosion of potential safety problems, many reasons to be broken, but apparently all the elements of its own can not avoid involvement.</p>
<p>Is usually a cathode of lithium battery, the anode, membrane, electrolyte, monomer packing five major components. At that time, Sony has developed the first commercial lithium batteries, the cathode of lithium compounds from lithium cobalt oxide is made, but because of cobalt are rare, then use more of manganese, iron, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/compaq-presario-2500-series.htm">compaq presario 2500 battery</a>  vanadium, nickel, etc., and synthetic polymer materials, and even the air electrode of the medium, different cathode materials, energy, security, operating voltage ranges.</p>
<p>Negative graphite and various hybrids, synthetic composite materials to play. Elements Graphite space, storage space for lithium-ion lattice.</p>
<p>Load, the cathode of lithium-ion transfer at the most negative of the box, where the negative electrode on the excessive accumulation of lithium-ion batteries to a certain limit, lithium-ion overflow, generating growth dendritic crystals and the spread of these crystals, the perforated diaphragm, so that positive and negative contacts, thus short-circuit occurs, this time short-circuit at the instant release a lot of heat, so easy to heat and combustion of the electrolyte boils, the final explosion, called &#8220;hot fail.&#8221; In addition, high temperature, piercing,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r32.htm">ibm thinkpad r32 battery</a> ventilation chip connectivity, and vehicle collisions caused by compression of the battery became positive and negative short-circuit in case of causes of insufficient heat.</p>
<p>Thus, although there are some problems such as using lithium solid polymer electrolyte, which does not reduce the possibility of leakage of an explosion, but because of the lithium battery is the outside world by a chemical reaction internal electrical charge into chemical energy stored in the battery Similarly, chemical energy by chemical reaction in the production of electrical energy, so that the process will produce temperatures, once the temperature is too high, Hazard was also followed.</p>
<p>In addition, the lithium battery itself has a self-discharge characteristics is that the battery is not charging the outside world, the release conditions is in chemical reactions under varying degree of speed, battery-performance self-discharge rate is low, and vice versa, &#8220;self-discharge&#8221; rate is high. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1245.htm">apple a1245 battery</a>  This internal chemical reaction on the table would make a music player, since the explosion took place in the OFF state.</p>
<p>Heat load and discharge the heat-absorbing characteristics of a lithium battery, but sometimes too fast charging will be the phenomenon of fever, because the chemical reaction is too late to chemical energy electric discharge the battery temperature is too late to chemical energy into electrical energy caused by the pricing if the management system generally safe, but there could be problems at the landfill.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, the discharge of the lithium battery current should not be too large if the current is too large, too long May cause a chemical reaction and heat of the intense heat, and even caught fire and exploded.</p>
<p>In fact, advertising on the lithium battery can be a fast charge, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10-s.htm">sony vgp-bps10/s battery</a>   rapid discharge of this concept is relatively lead-acid batteries, just a little faster, but if the charge and discharge of lithium across limits the danger could be hiding nearby.</p>
<p>As for lithium batteries in the end how appropriate discharge should be practical to decide, but for the vehicle driving cycle, the instantaneous high-current discharge are common, this is a test for lithium batteries.</p>
<p>Wages Now, load-discharge process is controllable, you can handle the manufacturing, metal powder, dust, and reduce the risk, but their chemical reactions inside the battery, but difficult to control.</p>
<p>From this, the process of lithium batteries in use, is a miniature &#8220;Volcano&#8221;, discarded after the lithium appears to be an &#8220;off&#8221;. After dismantling deleted as long as the body perplexed,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">dell inspiron 6400 battery</a> the &#8220;five elements&#8221; is completed, the chemical reaction will not be interrupted, but the level drops, and thus the recycling of lithium batteries alone the seal as dangerous goods .</p>
<p>After analyzing the principle of lithium, resulting in a failure factors, R &amp; D, manufacturers need to understand the lithium Angels &amp; Demons double-sided, and the need to find a way to minimize security risks .</p>
<p>Performances such as lion, tiger stadium, the trainer must be animal control, the current lithium batteries, &#8220;animal&#8221; was not that people understand and master, applied to batteries of high capacity rechargeable and operating conditions of vehicles, poor working conditions should be cautious of the transaction.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>People who travel frequently on the plane may have noticed that from this year lithium battery backup of electronic products can not be controlled, but they must wear, it is best to avoid the lithium battery of short-circuit caused the fire. Indeed, the lithium is not as dangerous as it seems on the surface, it may even become the next cell&#8217;s most important power the vehicle. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a> </p>
<p>Battery power to search</p>
<p>There are a variety of new energy vehicles by category, but according to the highest standards, only a pure electric vehicle is the full sense of new energy vehicles. Currently, the main driving force for new sources of energy vehicles, including nickel-hydrogen batteries, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">sony vgp-bps8 battery</a> </span></span>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm">sony vgp-bps8a battery</a>  fuel cells and lithium-iron batteries, lithium batteries and iron was the industry is recognized as a driving force in the direction of the most promising development.</p>
<p>At present, China can produce energy with the manufacturers of lithium iron phosphate are not numerous, the most famous BYD it Tianjin power of God, Vientiane CITIC Guoan Group, among others. Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Physics, Huang Xue-Jie said: &#8220;The ability to develop a more cost effective, reliable electric cars lithium battery is an important prerequisite for the ability to scale business, such as battery Lithium iron phosphate good security. However, phosphate lithium iron phosphate batteries accounted for 80% of the cost of the battery, this is not done yet.</p>
<p>It is understood that China is the largest lithium iron phosphate energy density of the battery can reach 80Wh/kg, near the international advanced level.  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gd761.htm">dell gd761 battery</a> National Development and Reform Commission Automobile Expert Group, the China Automobile Manufacturers Executive Vice President and Secretary-General Chang Shu-Lin, said: &#8220;Our goal from the battery power is to reduce development costs by 2020 two thirds of the energy density more than double.</p>
<p>Nanchang AMI Technology Co., Ltd. has launched an A-level pure electric cars, charging a mileage of 180 to 220 km / h about 90 km / hour battery life of about 25 thousand kilometers. Nanchang AMI Operating Officer weeks LU Qing said: &#8220;The price of the car about 18 million, if we take into account national and local grants, the consumer price actually paid about 60,000 yuan. The biggest cost of the car battery, battery cost is about 6-70000 yuan. &#8221;</p>
<p>Wind in the sails of electric vehicles</p>
<p>Although the lithium iron phosphate are still expensive, and other industrial problems, but the electric car industry has not remained unresolved, the current national companies in the management of electric vehicle power, motor control, spends much ink on the ground.</p>
<p>Nanchang AMI Operating Officer weeks LU Qing said: &#8220;Our cars have self-developed energy management and engine control technology, is now certified by the United States, we export American cars cost about 10 yuan per vehicle. &#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the University of Nanchang in Jiangxi Province under the Innovation and Technology Development Co., Ltd. Tai Cheong has been dedicated to electric vehicles, power modules,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4812a.htm">hp f4812a battery</a> research and industrialization, management current power systems, motor control systems, super capacitors and other key technologies to achieve a breakthrough. Public Information, University of Nanchang and Jiangxi Changhe Automobile Co., Ltd. based on the new cooperation Changhe Ideal II developed the model of pure electric vehicles, have complete independent rights of intellectual property, has now entered the phase of industrialization.</p>
<p>A staff member of the company told reporters, &#8220;Chang major innovation in electric vehicles, power modules, industrialization began in October of this year, now has a corporate vehicle in Jiangxi has reached a letter Preliminary plans for the major innovation for businesses Cheong Electric power modules for automotive production electric vehicle.</p>
<p>However, the lithium iron phosphate giant BYD Liu, senior director of the just the right balance between technology and the market has a more sober understanding. He told reporters: &#8220;I personally believe that for the electric car, the business model is more important than battery technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, the model of inner workings of purely electric cars are still not clear, a few points recharging station, load the way the industry and replacement batteries for fast charging mode has its own supporters .  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-fru-92p1141.htm">ibm fru 92p1141 battery</a> Pure electric vehicles operating mode restricting the electric car will probably be a major bottleneck in development.</p>

Car-Power LiFePO4 batteries will be used to get a load more in the car,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4809a.htm">hp f4809a battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4812a.htm">hp f4812a battery</a> wish to introduce products to compete with car manufacturers Volt may be interested.</p>
<p>Nanowire battery becomes a prospect for a solution</p>
<p>Another promising line of technology of lithium batteries is the nano-batteries to cover the battery stainless steel cathode lithium silicon nanowires to replace the traditional graphite anodes. Silicon can store ten times more lithium than graphite, so that power density has increased significantly. The total mass of the battery to reduce the surface area increased to allow faster load / speed.</p>
<p>The battery using the cathode surface covered by the line of silicon steel contraction / expansion of output power. Charging process, the silicon-ray absorptiometry in charge of the lithium atoms, the expansion occurred; discharge process, the line of silicon lithium-ion batteries being sucked, the linear shrinkage of silicon.</p>
<p>Under the electron microscope of silicon nanowires in the absorption of lithium before (left) and after (right) pictures. Network was extended to four times the normal volume, there is no damage.</p>
<p>The conventional silicon and simple positive studies, which began over 30 years. Scientists then decided to abandon silicon because this material easier to mobilize when the absorption of the division of lithium, damaged, cathode capacity is low enough to support further research.</p>
<p>Researchers at Stanford University was used to determine the problem stems from the shape of the silicon material.</p>
<p>The current method for a diameter of a thousandth of the thickness of nanowires paper tree. After the nano-size lithium-ray absorptiometry, was extended to four times the state standard,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-1brs.htm">toshiba pa3399u-1brs battery</a> but will not break or damage the cathode of silicon.</p>
<p>Researchers battery nanowires are looking for an anode material is adapted to match with silicon net charge of positive / discharge capacity, to fully demonstrate the technology of the density of energy storage advances outstanding. Stanford University assistant professor of materials science and engineering, leading the team to develop this technology CRT YiCui, they think that after five years nanowire lithium-ion rechargeable battery technology, can achieve full commercialization.</p>
<p>Several technologies for more than just the start, with in-depth study of the continuation of the battery, electronics, players can expect the battery life is more than a toy&#8217;s life that day there.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) Researchers have developed a new technology may become a long and thin fiber-like solar <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">batteries </a>.</p>
<p>      With the dye sensitized solar cells (dye-sensitized solar cell) and the combination of fiber optic cable casing, Georgia Institute of Technology researchers have demonstrated a thin, soft solar cells, and its effectiveness is seen as achieving the same material flat solar <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">batteries</a>  of sixfold.</p>
<p>      &#8220;We are at the end of the fiber directly into the sun.&#8221; Georgia Institute of Technology professor Zhong Lin Wang (Wang Lin) said: &#8220;In the fiber placement next to an external load (external load) links with the electrode, we can gather loads generated. &#8220;Wang is a researcher at the School and Benjamin Weintraub Yaguang Wei completed the study.<br />
Dye-sensitized solar cell was invented in the 1990s is a film like solar energy program is different from the application of expensive materials for solar cell silicon semiconductor to generate electricity, dye <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4809a.htm">battery</a>  sensitized solar is surrounded by a metal film of electrolyte in the oxidation of zinc nanowire (nanowire) using cheap dye molecules (dye molecules) film. When the sun shine a light on the cells in the dye molecules, they shot the electronics, metal film, and sent to external electrodes.</p>
<p>      Traditional solar panels luck, a little problem is the incident photon can be degraded by heat, before the excited electrons in the metal, but on the contrary, the fiber allows the photons to have more opportunities and the active layer (active layer ) interactions. Wang has built a prototype is to use the 20-cm-long optical fiber to ensure that the length of the maximum amount of photons absorbed.</p>
<p>      This technique can cut collect sunlight-edge optical fiber, then down the light in fiber optics, and developed a new version of the future may use a metal outer sheath transparent so that light from the inside with outside. The researchers also plan to manufacture sub-systems in a bundle that contains hundreds of parallel fiber-optic cable.</p>
<p>      The research team is also considering this new type of solar <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">battery</a>  efficiency of energy conversion from the current 3.3% to 8%, much of the marketing. Wang said he intended to use less material cost, low cost fiber optics to conduct experiments, and the use of titanium dioxide, zinc oxide instead of continuing to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>      In practice, such a solar cell allows product designers to develop new forms of commercial or military applications, fiber solar cells can be incorporated in equipment used to supply.</p>
