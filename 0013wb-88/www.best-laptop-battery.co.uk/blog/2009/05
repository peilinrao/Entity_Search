<p>Q: My IBM T21 notebook&#8217;s battery life is only less than 1 hour, then run the program more likely to maintain only about half an hour. Are there any ways to allow the battery to restore it? Before the battery can also use more than 1 hour, and now getting worse.</p>
<p>A: The battery in use after a period of time will be aging, it is a concrete manifestation of resistance become larger, in charge when the voltage rise faster, so it is easy to charge control circuit has been judged to have full capacity is of course also dropped. Due to relatively large internal resistance battery discharge when the voltage drop, fast, the system can easily be mistaken for lack of voltage, lack of electricity (in fact there is no electric release). <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d430.htm">dell latitude d430 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d500.htm">dell latitude d500 battery</a>From the above description we can see that the battery is a vicious cycle of aging process, after the discovery of the working hours of battery out faster when you should exercise it, or else will be finished sooner or later. Battery calibration is to deal with an effective way of aging batteries, in general, the various brands of laptop batteries will have the exclusive use of calibration software, IBM laptop battery is also natural. If a person has been repeatedly discharge rechargeable, notebook battery may be appropriate to restore and re-rejuvenated.</p>
<p>Discharge under the DOS software, when all the end of the notebook will automatically shut down at this time can be connected to AC power for charging, the time control in 9 ~ 12 hours, repeated 2 or 3 times can be. In addition to that, can not be used when the battery completely, we do not need to replace the entire battery plate, so too costly, at least have about 800 yuan. We recommend that all point to the maintenance (Note, do not go to the Warranty Department manufacturers to develop, where no such service) or e-marketplace, let professionals help you update the look of the battery cell core subsamples plate, the effect with the purchase of a new battery is exactly the same, and charges only 200 yuan.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Used batteries to deal with difficulties</p>
<p>Last year, Nanjing 2000 barrels to collect used batteries from the tertiary institutions in Nanjing, organs such as office areas and residential areas to the recovery of 33 tons of used batteries. However, on the recycling of used batteries has always been a problem.</p>
<p>Before the State Environmental Protection Administration and other departments jointly issued the battery waste pollution prevention and control technology policy, which identifies the focus of the recovery of used batteries is discarded rechargeable batteries and button batteries. In this regard, the Office of Municipal Waste Segregation in the collection of day-to-day work, they noted that many of these batteries is not only a very small part. At the same time, according to the survey, the country has reached a low mercury or mercury-free disposable battery waste a lot of the same or contain harmful substances. Many members of the public consciousness has not yet used batteries should be put in categories.</p>
<p>Random in the vicinity of Shanxi two district asked 56 people, the elderly generally not distinguish whether the battery is rechargeable, and there are several people that he rarely used rechargeable batteries. Some of them that ordinary people have not thrown with the life of the battery separately, if also at what rechargeable batteries, and even more trouble.</p>
<p>Separate collection of municipal refuse staff office told reporters that battery recycling technology in the country is a difficult problem and even the whole world, every year a lot of enthusiasm to the public and university students used batteries to do research in this area, but there are still no good solution, the collection of used batteries to the main door to the vicinity of Nanjing a warehouse, from environmental protection departments to focus on, mainly landfill. The reason is that a machine used batteries to deal with the need to import from abroad, and the high cost of a large throughput, can handle every day for several tons of batteries, used batteries, Nanjing local enough that it simply &#8220;eat&#8221; a few days from around the brought to focus on cities, which also involves a lot of problems. Cost of this approach is still used batteries so that now the only solution to the old landfill.</p>
<p>Office staff said that at present, only the work to be done to further promote the collection barrels will be used batteries in the garbage as far as possible from the spin-off, to reduce environmental pollution, this year, Nanjing, they will conduct a study of six urban areas, in accordance with the demand for and then placed a number of barrels to collect used batteries, raise awareness of environmental protection.</p>

Panasonic will be February 20 of the products to market, its price will be 37,900 yen (about 355 U.S. dollars). Chengdu courtyard where residents have finally lost the place used batteries. Yesterday was informed that in order to achieve the objectives of the creation of Environmental Protection Model City, Chengdu, the first batch of nearly 100 recently has been a &#8220;battery recycling boxes&#8221; installed on a residential compound. Used batteries will be unified departments recovery, battery factory and then transported to the city for special treatment.</p>
<p>Battery recycling bins into the area, marking the beginning of the full establishment of Chengdu, the risk of waste collection system of classification, after the danger of the existence of disorderly conditions of garbage will be completely resolved.</p>
<p>Learned from relevant departments, a total investment of the risk of nearly 1 billion junk storage and processing center is expected to completed in the next year to deal specifically with used batteries, slag, smelting, as well as organic solvents, such as Java. According to the plan, the center occupies an area of a few mu, and mu in the next building on the landfill.</p>

<p>Officials in recent days the United States and Japan cooperative research in clean hydrogen energy technology to reach a consensus. January 8, in Japan, visiting U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry signed a cooperative research on hydrogen and fuel cell technology of paper battery technology. Abraham said that international cooperation is the key to achieve both goals. Hydrogen battery is considered a clean and highly efficient battery. People to promote the use of hydrogen energy, said people will no longer be dependent on oil, they asked for a reduction in pollution. Japan and the United States officials and technical experts will be in fuel cells and technology policy, as well as hydrogen production, storage and transport technology cooperation. Japan and the United States is the &#8220;hydrogen economy International Cooperation Organization&#8221; members. The organization set up in November last year to promote hydrogen production, storage, transport and end-user and technical exchanges, to complete the common use of hydrogen battery code and meet the relevant standard.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>The mystery of laptop batteries</p>
<p>Laptop battery has been a large number of primary users are mysterious, and the author of this article will analyze all aspects of your laptop battery secret.</p>
<p>1: knowledge articles:</p>
<p>Notebook computers are currently used in lithium-ion battery as its power source, for they were not equipped with a notebook battery, the notebook has completely lost the meaning of its own, with a kind of mobile PC is no different, so that the notebook computer battery for notebook computers is very important qualitative components. So lithium ion batteries and in the end we use every day What is the difference between ordinary rechargeable batteries which? Why is the use of lithium-ion notebook batteries which the price would be so expensive?</p>
<p>Would first like to say that the nature of laptop batteries and ordinary rechargeable batteries are not like, but all major manufacturers for their models to increase the appearance of a battery casing, so that if the ripping out of notebook batteries shell, the internal structure of the battery pack and the general there is no difference, that is another major constraint generic brand notebook batteries notebook computer is the greatest obstacle between the major brands of independent design.</p>
<p>If you are a master, you can already do-it-yourself life is close to the notebook computer for the core, the process is rather simple and only through the original method to connect the battery to re-connect to form a complete, parameters and the original the same battery pack, the real difficulty is the need to purchase suitable batteries, as used in laptop batteries batteries battery manufacturers are a direct supplier, so that the market could see very little retail batteries, in particular, lithium-ion batteries, this product is very rare in the market, the replacement of a certain degree of difficulty, In addition, the early Ni-MH batteries and the current mainstream of the internal batteries of the lithium battery circuit different, it is not used interchangeably, which need to be reminded those who want to do friends.</p>
<p>A closer look at the internal battery, which is actually several groups of series-parallel circuit the battery, in general, by a single laptop battery battery capacity and voltage requirements of the constraints, generally use the laptop battery after the first series of parallel approach to ensure its operating voltage and battery capacity, an analogy, if a nominal 12.5V, 4000MAh notebook battery, is composed of a general rule: first 3 single voltage 4.2V, 2000MAh batteries in series, to achieve its 12.5V nominal voltage, and then as a group composed of the battery unit further parallel circuit, the battery&#8217;s overall capacity to 4000MAh, this battery is also said to 6CELL general battery.</p>
<p>To see that the principle mentioned above, it is estimated that you can already feel the maintenance department to replace laptop battery prices on a group of thousand dollars, and even a few thousand dollars of the standard is how the profits. The purpose of their profits have been able to achieve, mainly because:</p>
<p>Core industrial lithium batteries are rare, since their appearance is different from the difficulty of replacement, the replacement of a high technical threshold.</p>
<p>All of these factors are constraining the user&#8217;s own battery maintenance more difficult, but also led to a considerable vendor repair station revenue windfall. Currently on the market there were a lot of customers on behalf of the notebook lithium batteries to replace the businesses, which cater to the vast number of consumers on the taste, if your notebook battery in need of repair, you can try this approach.</p>
<p>2: the use of maintenance articles:</p>
<p>Notebook battery maintenance requires a lot of skills, after all, the battery is a consumable, how in his life in a better service for you is the user should consider the issue for fear that the battery with a bad day will not be willing to notebook battery inserted in the computer users, it is a bit ridiculous, as long as know how to maintain, you can rest assured that the use of batteries, can also maintain its long life. So how to do what should be specific?</p>
<p>Do the best with the principle of exhaustion, which is the most important principle to maintain, but also to ensure maximum battery laptop best way to maintain the best display in the battery to 10% charge again, when the red battery capacity 90% of the time into the power supply will be diverted to the maintenance of a small current of the charge, this time, it is best not to unplug the power, let the battery fully be maintained, and in full power, the pulling power is no need, because it is charging circuit will automatically cut off the charging circuit, replaced by the power of direct transmission of power will not be affected by multi-battery.</p>
<p>High-temperature environment to avoid the use of lithium batteries, expert studies, high temperature conditions will accelerate the aging process of lithium batteries, and not to the same extreme low temperature environment. Low temperatures will reduce the activity of lithium batteries to reduce battery life notebook.</p>
<p>Li-ion battery regularly activate processing, is fully charged and discharged, so that the restoration of the maximum capacity of lithium batteries. Approach is that the closure of all power management, so that the notebook slowly discharge until they have no electricity, and then fully charged, can be repeated two or three.</p>
<p>Hot weather, as much as possible to maintain their own notebook batteries, notebook computers allow better play their role. Laptop battery will not want to become part of your maintenance headaches.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Experts talk about the right laptop battery charging and use of</p>
<p>We love machine How lithium battery maintenance to be correct? This problem has plagued many loyal users of laptop computers, including me. In access to some information, have the opportunity not long ago an electrochemical professional advice at the time of Dr. and a well-known domestic battery, deputy director of the Institute. The recently acquired a number of relevant knowledge and experience to write out to satisfy your readers.</p>
<p>Lithium-ion battery cathode material of lithium are usually composed of the active compounds, the negative electrode is a special molecular structure of carbon. Common cathode materials for major components of LiCoO2, charging, the increase in the bipolar battery of the electric potential positive force the release of lithium-ion compounds, embedded negative elements were arranged lamellar structure of the carbon. Discharge, the lithium-ion from the lamellar structure of the carbon in precipitation, and re-cathode combination of the compounds. Lithium-ion movement have had a current.</p>
<p>Although the principle of chemical reaction is very simple, but in the actual industrial production, the need to consider much more practical issues: the needs of cathode material additives to maintain the charge on many occasions put the activity, the need for negative electrode materials at the molecular level to design the structure to accommodate more lithium ion; fill in the electrolyte between the positive and negative, in addition to maintaining stability, but also need to have good electrical conductivity, reducing the battery internal resistance.</p>
<p>Change the shape of a variety of notebook batteries</p>
<p>Although few lithium-ion batteries Ni-Cd battery memory effect, memory effect is the crystallization of the principle, in the lithium batteries will not have nearly such a response. However, lithium-ion rechargeable battery in a number of post-release will continue to decline in capacity, its causes are complex and diverse. Anode material is mainly the change itself, from the molecular level, is negative on the hole to accommodate the structure of lithium-ion will gradually collapse, plug; from a chemical point of view, is a passive activity of anode materials are there to form a stable reaction of the other compounds. Physics will emerge gradually falling off the cathode material, etc. In short, the end can reduce the freedom of battery charge and discharge process of lithium-ion mobile number.</p>
<p>Over-charging and over-discharge, the lithium-ion battery cathode is caused permanent damage, from the molecular level, can be an intuitive understanding of the excessive discharge of carbon anode will lead to excessive release of lithium ion and allow its lamellar structure collapsed, over &#8211; rechargeable lithium-ion would be too much hard carbon anode into the structure going, and makes some lithium-ion can no longer be released. This is why lithium-ion batteries are usually equipped with charge-discharge control circuit of the reasons.</p>
<p>Not suitable for the temperature, will lead to an internal lithium-ion batteries to generate other chemical reactions that we do not want to see the compounds, so a lot of lithium-ion batteries are among the negative control with protective membrane or electrolyte additives. The battery reaches a certain temperature, the composite membrane electrolyte membrane hole closed or degeneration, increased battery internal resistance until the circuit, the battery is no longer up to ensure that the battery temperature is normal.</p>
<p>And deep-filling can take to enhance the practical lithium-ion battery capacity? Experts clearly told me that this is meaningless. They even said that the so-called pre-release of three all-sufficient &#8220;activation&#8221;, in their knowledge of the two, Dr. Lane, is also not convinced that what is necessary. Why do so many people, however deep-rechargeable Battery Information released in the future will be marked changes in this capacity? Behind will be mentioned.</p>
<p>Li-ion laptop batteries are generally with the management of chip and charge control chips. Management chip which has a series of registers, there is capacity, temperature, ID, state-of-charge, discharge frequency values. These values are in use will gradually change. I personally believe that the use of notebook computers in the description of &#8220;the use of one month after the full charge should take a&#8221; major role in the practice should be amended is inappropriate in these register values, making the battery charge control and battery with a nominal capacity of the actual situation.</p>
<p>The main charge control chips to control the battery charging process. Rechargeable lithium-ion battery process is divided into two phases, fast charge constant current phase (when the battery indicator light yellow) and the descending phase of constant current (the battery indicator light flashes green. Constant current fast charge phase, the battery voltage gradually increased to the standard battery voltage, and then transferred to the next chip in the control of constant phase, higher voltage is no longer than necessary and sufficient to ensure that no current will rise as the battery gradually weakened to 0, and the final charge.</p>
<p>Statistics chip power consumption records through the discharge curve (voltage, current, time) can calculate the sample battery power, this is what we read in the Battery Information in wh. Value. The lithium-ion batteries used in many occasions, the discharge curve may change, if the chip has not been the opportunity to once again read out a complete discharge curve, its power consumption calculated is not accurate. Therefore, we need to put the deep filling of the chip to calibrate the battery.</p>
<p>Finally, I battery maintenance view is:</p>
<p>1. No need to deliberately ensure that every time a re-release END electric charge;<br />
2. A period of time can be under the control of a protection circuit for deep-rechargeable battery release power to amend the statistics, but it does not increase the actual capacity of your battery.<br />
3. The long-term without the batteries, should be placed on a cool place to weaken its own passive response to its internal speed.<br />
4. The protection circuit is also able to monitor the battery self-discharge, long-term without the battery, should allow a certain degree of power into the battery to prevent self-discharge in storage in the discharge of excessive lead to excessive damage.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no battery to take into account the use of too much attention, in other words is taken into account and has little use. A battery to use the number of times, perhaps more from differences in the manufacture of the battery itself, the individual differences, rather than use. Choice of word-of-mouth has a good brand of notebook computers is the future use of long-life battery, one of the security.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>NB battery market forecast Q3 of this year there is room for price cuts</p>
<p>Core notebook battery (Cell) South Korea the main supplier of LG, Matsushita, Sanyo and other large capacity expansion plans from the second quarter of this year, will be out, the market expected this year, the supply of global cell growth compared with last year amounted to Third, as supply and demand balance is expected in the second quarter, notebook computer batteries in the third quarter of this year there will be room for price cuts.</p>
<p>Good notebook computer parts market, many battery manufacturers are also planning to enter the market. Hon Hai Group, the production of connectors, console and mobile phone batteries are Wei, was also reported for the international OEM customers Dell laptop battery production; addition, China&#8217;s production of mobile phone battery maker BYD is also prepared to cross-scrape of a knife sharpening into the production of notebook batteries.</p>
<p>Part of a laptop pointed out on behalf of industry, including the panel, such as hard disk and battery module suppliers to expand production lines last year, the second half of action, will be in the second quarter of fermentation, the production capacity substantially out, the price will be a growing component The more expensive, will be Intel&#8217;s processor price cuts in March this year, since the second half of a laptop is bound to further lower price.</p>
<p>A notebook computer factory in charge of that battery is an important notebook computer components, but the majority of cell technology in the hands of the Japanese hands last year, Japanese production is subject to supply less than the price rise, production in the second quarter to open one after another after, the situation will change.</p>
<p>Notebook computers in response to the demand for a rapid increase in the battery module, the production of batteries Panasonic batteries are the Japanese companies to expand a production line, in addition to Japanese Sanyo, LG and Samsung, the Korean maker is expanding production lines, one of LG this year, in May all about capacity out, Samsung is about to open in June a major production plant next year focused on the end of the second quarter, opened the third quarter, and were two to three times the growth of notebook computer batteries last year in short supply situation in the second half of this year will be alleviated.</p>
<p>Notebook computer industry estimates, if the notebook computer market last year percent growth to estimate growth rate of cell production will exceed demand, so do not rule out the battery module has room for price cuts, but still, as the notebook market this year may be required.</p>

<p>As a result of solid waste disposal center in Fuzhou used batteries not disposal sites completed so far collected about 30 tons of used batteries are still sealed in the warehouse, waiting for disposal. State Environmental Protection Administration and other departments recently released &#8220;Waste Battery Pollution Prevention and Technology Policy&#8221; provides that bear the recycling of waste and spent rechargeable batteries button batteries in the responsibility of manufacturers, importers, and its vendors should be set up in the sales of scrap batteries separation and recovery facilities to be recovered. However, manufacturers believe that recycling costs are too high. In the city of Fuzhou and Xiamen City and several major department stores electrical commercial, not a battery in accordance with national vendors provides for the establishment of new recycling facilities.</p>
<p>At the same time, the policy does not encourage countries to focus the collection has reached a low mercury or mercury-free standard used batteries, affecting the recovery of the public and the enthusiasm of the departments concerned. Fuzhou, the City established recycling collection point 37 of the battery capacity has become less and less.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Activation of used batteries is expected to recover</p>
<p>Developed by Tsinghua University and other units of lead-acid battery recovery super technology, has entered the stage to promote the industrialization of formal recruitment in the country at all levels of the regional agent.</p>
<p>In all types of batteries, lead-acid batteries the largest share, accounting for the secondary battery market, according to 75%, is widely used in automotive, communications, finance, electric power, railway, aviation, marine, mining and other industries. Waste of the environmental pollution caused by the battery has become the world&#8217;s problems. China more than 5000 each year about 10,000, more than 300,000 tons of spent lead-acid batteries. Super recovery of lead-acid battery technology can be used on all types of lead-acid batteries for recovery activation. Detection by the Ministry of Information Industry, confirmed that the recovery rate of more than 96%.</p>
<p>It is reported that a vast reservoir of the technology market. In 2002, domestic output of lead-acid batteries, nearly 80 billion yuan, and each year to grow at a rate of 30%. Super use of lead-acid battery technology used to recover the battery recovery, the average cost to buy a new battery less than 1 / 4, which will save users a lot of money. With the industrialization of the technology promotion, running into billions of dollars annual output value of the used batteries is expected to recover activation of the birth of industry.</p>
