                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Fourth, in the automotive fuel cell Motorcycles<br />
China&#8217;s fuel cell research began in 1958, the 70&#8217;s in the aerospace industry, driven by fuel-cell research showed the first climax. &#8220;Ninth Five-Year Plan&#8221; period, the Ministry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences of fuel cell technology with the inclusion of &#8220;scientific research&#8221; a major cause of development projects, the goal is to use our advantages in resources, starting from a high starting point to enhance innovation. In the &#8220;Ninth Five-Year Plan&#8221; period, China&#8217;s fuel cell technology development closer to international standards. The elements of a &#8220;proton exchange membrane fuel cell technology&#8221;, &#8220;molten carbonate fuel cell technology&#8221; and &#8220;solid oxide fuel cell technology,&#8221; the three projects, which for the electric car &#8220;5kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell&#8221; as developed focus. This task by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute to assume a number of departments, what the target had been fully achieved.</p>
<p>In the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), the China research and development of these batteries have reached the skill level can be loaded, you can compete with developed countries in the world, but also in market share, it can be and able to occupy a certain proportion. Since the proton exchange membrane fuel cell as a &#8220;Ninth Five-Year&#8221; plan focuses on scientific and technological projects, the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, as the lead units across the country carried out a comprehensive proton exchange membrane fuel cell battery materials and battery systems research, great progress has been made, have assembled more than 100 watts, 1kW ~ 2kW, 5kW, 10kW to 30kW battery and battery system. 5kW battery pack inside the humidifier, including part of its power to weight ratio 100W/kg, smaller than the power of 300W / L. Proton exchange membrane fuel cell bike has been successfully developed, have been developed for electric bicycle 200w fuel cell system. From 6 5kW battery pack consisting of 30kW battery system has been successfully used for China&#8217;s first fuel cell power source minibus. Loading the battery maximum output power up to 46kw. At present, the vehicle a top speed of 60.6km / h, for fuel cell electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicle development and lay a good foundation. The overall performance of the cell stack is equivalent to Mercedes-Benz, Ford and Canada jointly developed Balad MK7 proton exchange membrane fuel cell electric vehicle level. &#8220;Tenth Five-Year&#8221; period, the State Ministry of Science and Technology to fuel cell electric vehicles as the national &#8220;863&#8243; program, China&#8217;s ongoing high-power proton exchange membrane fuel cell group to develop and fuel cell engine system integration studies. It is reported that Sino-US cooperation, &#8220;China&#8217;s commercialization of fuel cell bus demonstration projects&#8221; have been implemented in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively, choosing a bus route to carry out demonstration tests. The project includes not only fuel cell vehicle itself, will also fuel cell commercialization process of various infrastructure, capacity-building, training for a full range of test model, which will greatly promote China&#8217;s commercial fuel cell vehicle development progress, to industry estimates, after 10 years of China&#8217;s fuel cell industry is expected to form a vapor.<br />
1, fuel cell (PEMFC) applications in the automotive<br />
Fuel cells used in vehicles as early as the 20th century in the 50&#8217;s General Electric company invented proton exchange membrane fuel cell. At present, this fuel cell is the most car companies prefer to use a class of fuel cells, used to replace the original use of the internal combustion engine. Proton exchange membrane fuel cell is also called polymer electrolyte membrane, or solid polymer electrolyte membrane, or polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell.<br />
Proton exchange membrane fuel cell<br />
In the proton exchange membrane fuel cell, the electrolyte is a thin polymer membrane, such as poly [perfluoro methyl] acid (poly [perfluoro sulphonic] acid), and protons to penetrate, but not conductive NafionTM, and basic by carbon electrode group Cheng. Inflow of hydrogen fuel cells reach the anode, cracking into hydrogen ions (protons) and electronic. Hydrogen ions through the electrolyte to infiltrate into the cathode, and the electronic network through an external flow of electricity. To air in the form of oxygen supply to the cathode, and electronic and hydrogen ions combine to form water. In the electrode these reactions are as follows:<br />
Anode: 2H2 → 4H + + 4e -<br />
Cathode: O2 + 4H + + 4e-→ 2 H2O<br />
Overall: 2H2 + O2 → 2 H2O + energy<br />
Proton exchange membrane fuel cell operating temperature is about 80 ℃. In such a low temperature, the electrochemical reaction can be carried out normally slow, usually with each electrode to a thin layer of platinum catalyst.<br />
This electrode / electrolyte devices are often referred to as membrane electrode assembly (MEA), its caught in the middle of two field flow plates will be able to constitute the fuel cell. Both boards have a trench will be directed to the electrodes of fuel, but also through the membrane electrode assembly conductive. Each cell can produce about 0.7 volts of electricity, enough for the use of a lighting bulbs. Drive a car you will need about 300 volts of electricity. In order to obtain a higher voltage, will be more than a single battery can be formed in series with people known as the fuel cell memory.<br />
Proton exchange membrane fuel cell has many features, has therefore become an ideal vehicle energy, it can replace the rechargeable batteries.</p>
<p>It at a lower temperature, so in cold conditions, a prompt start. Its high power density, so its size is relatively small. In addition, the high efficiency of the battery can get 40 to 50% of the maximum theoretical voltage, and can quickly and in accordance with the needs of electricity to change its output. When a car to use methanol or natural gas reforming hydrogen fuel cells as fuel instead of gasoline internal combustion engine, its carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced as much as 72 percent, and the efficiency of internal combustion engine, compared to about 25 percent, their efficiency can be as high as 60%. Methanol fuel cells for fuel, the fuel utilization rate is 1.76 times that of diesel fuel. The only potential problem is the quality of fuel, in order to avoid such a low-temperature catalyst to be contaminated, proton exchange membrane fuel cells do not have to use hydrogen fuel pollution.</p>
<p>At present, all over the world, in the Legislative forced car manufacturers will be able to greatly reduce the emissions limits of vehicles, proton exchange membrane fuel cell for such demands have led to substantial opportunities. Now, the majority of vehicle manufacturers, as the proton exchange membrane fuel cell for the internal combustion engine successor. In this process, the use of different vehicles and the use of different parts of the trial goes smoothly, using proton exchange membrane fuel cell buses provide the impetus for the pilot in Vancouver and Chicago have been a success. Germany&#8217;s cities also conducted a similar test, there are dozens of European cities will also be tested on the bus, London and California, will also be planning to carry out tests on small vehicles. At present, can produce 50 kW of electricity demonstration unit has been in use, can produce up to 250 kW device is also being developed.<br />
2, fuel cell applications in the motorcycle<br />
Development of fuel cell motorcycle, in fact, its core technologies &#8211; fuel cell research and development. Hydrogen is the only fuel cell in the direct application of the fuel, but nature does not hydrogen gas resources, can only come from other forms of energy such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, diesel, coal, biomass and alcohol, the use of all avenues for produced. However, all avenues are not feasible, the cost is not low. Of particular importance is still unable to break through the technical bottleneck, and its liquid hydrogen fuel Preparation, storage, transport and to add is a big problem. Therefore, to seek to substitute for direct use of hydrogen fuel cells and other fuel, thereby reducing the fuel cell system size and cost, fuel cell motorcycle is the focus of the study. Tests confirmed that methanol is an ideal alternative fuel. Because methanol fuel only to generate carbon dioxide and water, and methanol is the simplest of liquid organic compounds, in the market a complete sales network, storage security, and easy to carry. At the same time, as a result of motorcycle power only 1.5 ~ 3kw, will have a direct methanol fuel cell used in motorcycle is possible. Therefore, the people&#8217;s direct methanol fuel cell was very interested.<br />
Direct methanol fuel cells do not need re-engineering and direct methanol as fuel. Methanol in the anode into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, as the standard proton exchange membrane fuel cell, the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen. In the electrode these reactions are as follows:<br />
Anodic reaction: CH3 OH + H2O → CO2 + 6H + + 6e -<br />
Cathode reaction: O2 + 6H + + 6e-→ 3 H2O<br />
Cell reaction: CH3OH + O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O<br />
Such expectations of the work of the battery temperature is 120 ℃, than the standard of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell is slightly higher, its efficiency is about 40%. Its drawback is that when the low temperature methanol converted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide than when conventional proton exchange membrane fuel cells need more platinum catalyst. However, this increase in cost can be due to easy access to liquid fuel and can Needless to revitalize the work of dwarfs.<br />
To sum up, from the world&#8217;s fuel cell to see the momentum of rapid development, the first decade of this century will be the provider of fuel cell technology, an important stage of industrialization, its technical relevance, the cost of production, such as a major breakthrough was achieved. Efficient, environmentally friendly fuel cell vehicles produced, and commercialization will certainly become an irresistible general trend</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>In the phone, whether it is from a technical point of assessment or from the price consideration, batteries are very important position. Value today, the market is selling the phones, used batteries have basically completed the battery from nickel to lithium batteries transition. Perhaps as a result of cell phone battery had just completed a nickel batteries to lithium batteries revolutionary, so people&#8217;s awareness of lithium batteries are not uniform, and in many cases not correct to say and practice is quite popular. Therefore, to understand that knowledge of lithium batteries, lithium batteries have the proper way of using it is very necessary.</p>
<p>First, the type of lithium battery:</p>
<p>At present the market of secondary batteries used mainly in nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) of two types. Lithium-ion batteries have been mass production of liquid lithium-ion battery (LiB) and polymer lithium-ion battery (LiP) two. Therefore, in many cases, battery on a mark of Li-ion, lithium-ion batteries must be. But not necessarily that of liquid lithium-ion battery, is also possible that the polymer lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p>Lithium-ion battery is a lithium battery modified products. Lithium batteries have a long time ago, but the lithium is a highly active (still remember it in the periodic table of elements in the right position?) Of the metal, it is not very safe when used often in charge when burning, burst situation, then there will be a modified lithium-ion batteries by adding the element lithium can inhibit the active ingredient (such as cobalt, manganese, etc.) so that the lithium can really achieve a safe, efficient, convenient, and the old lithium batteries also basically eliminated. As to how to distinguish them from the battery on the logo will be able to identify, lithium battery for Li, lithium-ion battery for Li-ion. Now, notebook and mobile phone use of the so-called &#8220;lithium batteries&#8221;, in fact, are lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p>The basic structure of modern batteries, including cathode, anode and electrolyte three elements. As a battery, lithium-ion battery also has these three elements. Lithium-ion technology in general or inorganic colloidal liquid electrolyte, so the need for solid combustible shell to accommodate the active ingredients, which increased the battery weight and cost, also limits the size and shape of flexibility. In general, liquid lithium ion secondary battery is the minimum thickness of 6mm, a further reduction on the more difficult.</p>
<p>The so-called polymer lithium-ion battery in the three major tectonic at least one or more of the use of polymer materials as its main battery system.</p>
<p>A new generation of polymer lithium-ion polymer batteries in the extent of the already very high, so the shape can be achieved on the shape of thin (the thinnest 0.5 mm), any size and any shape, and greatly improving the design of a flexible battery and thus be in line with the product demand has resulted in any shape and capacity of the battery. At the same time, polymer lithium-ion battery unit of energy than the current lithium-ion batteries in general increased 50 percent, of its capacity, charge-discharge characteristics, safety, working temperature range, cycle life and environmental performance and so on than a large lithium-ion battery margin improvement.</p>
<p>At present the market by sales of liquid lithium-ion (LiB) battery in the case of over-charging, and thus easily lead to the breakdown of the fire safety valve case, this is very dangerous, so necessary for the installation of the protection of IC circuits to ensure that the battery does not occur over Charging the case. The polymer lithium-ion battery connection, this type of battery is relatively liquid lithium-ion battery has a good resistance in terms of charge-discharge characteristics, it&#8217;s protected IC circuits can be appropriate to relax the requirements. Also in the charge, the polymer lithium-ion batteries can make use of IC constant current charging, with the lithium ion secondary battery used in CCCV (Constant Currert-Constant Voltage) charging method the time required for comparison, can shorten the waiting time for many.</p>
<p>Second, handset manufacturers on the application of lithium batteries</p>
<p>Although in recent years almost all manufacturers have a preference for lithium-ion batteries, but the world&#8217;s major handset manufacturers the choice of batteries or have their own characteristics and habits, for example, has a history in the same period:</p>
<p>Nokia: The Ni-MH (Ni-MH) battery, LiB (liquid lithium-ion) batteries, did not use the LiP (polymer lithium-ion) batteries.</p>
<p>Ericsson: The Ni-MH battery, LiB battery, LiP battery.</p>
<p>Motorola: the use of Ni-MH battery, LiB battery did not use the battery LiP.</p>
<p>Is not difficult to find, from the first choice for mobile phones LiP polymer lithium-ion batteries this matter, Ericsson reflect their true colors of a pioneer in handset technology. I find the information shows that the main polymer lithium-ion battery factory in Japan SONY, Panasonic, GS, such as companies, in 2000 the production capacity of 21 million, of which 50% for Ericsson mobile phones supporting. To enter in 2002 today, lithium-ion batteries in other mobile phone manufacturers also have a wide range of application and popularization. However, in polymer lithium-ion battery use, but also far from being reached on all mobile phone manufacturers of products to be of universal extent有待时日also widely used.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although the advantages of lithium-ion batteries a lot, but there are also shortcomings, such as high prices and fewer charge-discharge and so on. Lithium battery charge and discharge the number of only 400-600 times, specially to improve the products on many occasions, however 800. And nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries to reach the number of more than 700 times, some good quality products that charge and discharge up to 1200 times, such a comparison, the Ni-MH battery life than lithium batteries. In addition the price of nickel-hydrogen batteries are also much lower than the lithium batteries. Moreover, strictly speaking, lithium batteries have the same memory effect, but its memory effect is very low, basically negligible.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, there is no perfect battery.</p>
<p>Third, the use of lithium-ion battery</p>
<p>Part of this is the focus of this article, we discuss three points.</p>
<p>1, how to charge the battery for the new</p>
<p>In the use of lithium batteries should be noted that some time after the battery is placed into the dormant state, when the capacity is lower than normal, the use of time has also come to shorten. However, lithium batteries can easily activated, as long as after 3-5 times the normal charge-discharge cycle can be activated batteries, back to normal capacity. Due to the characteristics of lithium-ion battery itself has determined that it is almost no memory effect. Phone so that users of the new lithium battery in the activation process does not require special methods and equipment. Not only in theory, this is the case, from my own practice, from the very beginning, the use of standard methods of charging such a &#8220;natural activation&#8221; approach is the best.</p>
<p>Lithium batteries for the &#8220;activation&#8221; problem, many say is: charging time must be more than 12 hours, repeated three times to do in order to activate the battery. This &#8220;The first three charging more than 12 hours to charge&#8221; is obviously from the nickel battery (such as nickel cadmium and nickel metal hydride) inherited from the argument. Therefore, this argument can be said to misrepresent the start. Lithium batteries and nickel battery charge and discharge characteristics of a huge difference, but also very clear to tell you that I have access to all the serious formal technical information and over-emphasized rechargeable lithium-ion battery will discharge, in particular liquid lithium ion battery causing great harm. Thereby charge the best time and in accordance with the standards of the standard method of charging, especially not to carry out more than 12 hours of super-long charge. Typically, handset manuals introduced the charging method is suitable for the mobile phone standard charging method.</p>
<p>In addition, mobile phone or lithium batteries in the battery charger will automatically stop after a charge, there is no electricity nickel charger for 10 hours the so-called the &#8220;trickle&#8221; charge. In other words, if your lithium batteries in a later, on the white charger is also rechargeable. And we can not guarantee that no one battery charge and discharge protection circuit features and never change and the quality of safety, so your battery will be long-term hovering at the edge of danger. This is why we oppose the long charging another reason.</p>
<p>In addition, on some phones, charging more than a certain amount of time, if not remove the charger, when not only did not stop charging system, will also be the beginning of discharge &#8211; charge cycle. Perhaps this practice has its own purpose of vendors, it is clear that on the battery and cell phone / charger is the life of a disadvantaged position. At the same time, long charging would take a long time, often at night, and to China&#8217;s power grid situation, at night in many parts of the higher voltage, but also volatile. Said earlier, the lithium battery is very delicate than nickel in the electric charge and discharge aspects of fluctuations in the capacity of resistance is much less, so this brings additional risk.</p>
<p>In addition, can not be ignored another aspect is not suitable for lithium batteries have the same discharge, over-discharge of lithium batteries is also very unfavorable. This leads to the following questions.</p>
<p>2, normal use should begin charging</p>
<p>In our forums, often see this argument, because the number of charging and discharging is limited, so mobile phones should be used up as much as possible battery recharge. But I find a lithium-ion battery charge and discharge cycle test table, on the cycle life data is as follows:</p>
<p>Cycle life (10% DOD) &amp; # 118bscript:&gt; 1000 times</p>
<p>Cycle life (100% DOD) &amp; # 118bscript:&gt; 200 times</p>
<p>Which is the depth of discharge DOD abbreviation. Can be seen from the table, rechargeable frequency and depth of discharge, 10% DOD at the time of the life cycle than 100% DOD must be much longer. Of course, if the actual charge equivalent to the relative total capacity: 10% * 1000 = 100,100% * 200 = 200, which is fully charge and discharge, or better than some, but that argument in front of friends to do some of the amendments: Under normal circumstances, you should have a reservation in accordance with the remaining battery power and then run out of the principle of rechargeable charge, but if your battery is expected in the first two days you can not insist on the whole time during the day, they should have started on time charge, of course, if you are willing to back the charger to the office again when别论.</p>
<p>And you need to charge to cope with the anticipated upcoming busy communications will lead to an important event in a time when, even though there are many more than the battery power, then you just charge ahead of time, because you did not really loss of &#8220;1&#8243; sub-charge cycle life , that is, &#8220;0.x&#8221; times only, and often this x will be very small.</p>
<p>Run out of battery power and then filling the remainder of the principle does not mean that you go to the extreme. And long recharge widely as saying that &#8220;as far as possible the cell phone batteries run out, it is best to use automatic shutdown.&#8221; This approach is only on the practice of nickel batteries, to avoid occurrence of memory effect, unfortunately, it is also spread of lithium batteries on this. It has been too low because the cell phone battery warning appears, still do not charge to continue to use has been used in automatic shutdown example. The outcome of this case the cell phone later in the boot of charge and there was no response, had to give customer service overhaul. This is in fact due to excessive discharge as a result of the battery voltage is too low a result that does not have the normal charge and boot conditions.</p>
<p>3, on the lithium battery cell phone the right way</p>
<p>To sum up, my cell phone in the use of lithium-ion battery charging and discharging of the most important tips are:</p>
<p>1, in accordance with the standards and procedures, charging time, even the first three to do so;</p>
<p>2, When the phone prompts when electricity is too low, it should be possible to start charging a timely manner;</p>
<p>3, lithium batteries do not need to activate the special method, in normal use of cell phones will naturally activated lithium batteries. If you insist on using the spread of &#8220;the three previous 12-hour long activation charge&#8221; approach, in fact, will not have effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, all the pursuit of super-long 12-hour rechargeable lithium battery and the phone is used in automatic shutdown, are wrong. If you used to be in accordance with the wrong done, please correct and timely, and perhaps it is not too late.</p>
<p>Of course, in the mobile phone and charger circuit protection and control of their own good quality cases, the protection of lithium batteries or have guaranteed. Therefore, understanding the rules on the charge is the key, in some cases can make some concessions. For example, you discover that your phone must be recharged at night before going to bed, you can also begun to charge before going to bed. The crux of the matter, you should know what is the correct way and not in accordance with the deliberately wrong to do so.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>The safe use of digital camera batteries Manual</p>
<p>1, make no mistake battery is negative. AA rechargeable batteries used in digital cameras in particular, need to be aware that if a mistake is the battery (+) pole and negative (-) pole to use, is likely to have a short circuit caused by the danger of batteries overheating, causing the machine will be unstable or even damage .</p>
<p>2, to avoid purchasing substandard or counterfeit batteries battery. Many poor-quality batteries in the internal circuits, batteries and other materials used on the existence of security risks, many mobile phone battery explosion cases were caused by counterfeit products.</p>
<p>3, as far as possible to exhaust the battery power to conduct a full charge. This will extend the battery life, in addition, lithium-ion battery should also be avoided as far as possible at a high temperature and low temperature environment, so as not to affect the results. -<a href="http://www.mylaptopbattery.co.uk/dell-6y270.htm">dell 6Y270 battery</a></p>
<p>4, if the long-term non-use, it would be preferable to the rated capacity rechargeable battery half. Environment can be placed at room temperature. Save time and try to avoid contact with metal objects to avoid short circuit, not only undermine the battery, and can easily cause fires.</p>
<p>5, for AA rechargeable batteries. Best buy exactly the same as the composition of models of cell battery, do not have battery power and not batteries. Because both cases battery huge difference between the resistance, forcing the use of lead to a lot of battery power consumption in their own heat, the weight will make the battery leakage.</p>
<p>Observation</p>
<p>The lack of battery recycling mechanism</p>
<p>Digital discarded batteries into a major source of pollution</p>
<p>China each year from about 300 million mobile phones, notebook computers and other IT products, the need for end-of-life battery, the lack of appropriate laws and regulations and system recovery, consumers are generally used batteries will be discarded as ordinary garbage, and these are not the correct recovery battery has become alarming environmental pollution.</p>
<p>Statistics show that a piece of used batteries containing cadmium can be 60 tons of water pollution, the battery also contains a lot of gold, mercury, heavy metals such as lead, will be enormous on the natural environment pollution. If the pollutants through food, air, etc. enters the human body to achieve savings in the body after a certain amount, will enable people malformation or disease, or even death.</p>
<p>Battery contains a large number of harmful substances may trigger a genetic mutation, thereby affecting the next generation grow up healthily. In addition, the random discarded batteries unscrupulous traders are likely to be refurbished into a shoddy counterfeit batteries into the market, renovation batteries in use there is a big risk, it is easy to cause a short circuit, overheating, such as the risk of spontaneous combustion and explosion, endangering personal safety.</p>
<p>According to Xin Jiang in Beijing estimated that China&#8217;s current recovery rate of used batteries or even less than 1%. The reason is that our country has not formed a production, sale, use of the tripartite one battery recycling of used IT products processing mechanism, there is no uniform legislation to be bound.</p>
<p>Even the March 1, 2007 will come into effect the &#8220;Electronic Information Products Pollution Control Management Measures&#8221;, nor the details of norms in enterprises should take the recycling of waste electronic products obligations.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of binding regulations, from the interests of manufacturers, nor are they willing to pay to do things battery recycling. And users with a piece of scrap batteries, there is no awareness of recycling, or do not know how to recovery, can only throw away garbage together.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Compared with ordinary PC, laptop users the convenience of a soft spot for many. However, and all mobile devices, like laptops equally faced with severe energy supply problems &#8211; is the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1078.htm">apple a1078 battery</a> capacity. Can obviously feel, notebooks for each of the major components are more visible progress, and in the development of battery technology has as yet no breakthrough in this issue makes notebook battery constraints are increasingly becoming a bottleneck to function.</p>
<p>Although there is no way to immediately allow notebook <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1078.htm">a1078 battery</a> revolutionary change took place, but we can improve by changing the habits of practical notebook, so that battery life is lengthened. The following 17 is ready for notebook users to extend battery life practical method.</p>
<p>1. Regularly defragment</p>
<p>Finishing debris disk that allows you to work faster hard drive regularly defragment the hard disk can maintain efficient state, of course, is in the use of external power supply of the best finishing time. Faster disk corresponding shorter working hours, it will certainly reduce the power consumption to extend notebook battery life.</p>
<p>2. To reduce the screen brightness</p>
<p>Most computers can adjust the screen brightness, some can even reduce the CPU operating frequency. In the use of <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1078.htm">apple a1078 battery</a> time, reducing these parameters can be more effective to extend the battery life.</p>
<p>3. Close Daemon</p>
<p>Some running in the background, although not directly see the program to run, but in the consumption of the CPU processing power and, of course, the battery power consumption. The best way is to turn off the background of all unnecessary procedures in order to extend battery capacity.</p>
<p>4. To reduce the peripheral equipment</p>
<p>USB devices (including your mouse), Wi-Fi wireless connection will be able to consume battery power, when the equipment is not in use, the best pull down or masked. There are some equipment, such as the iPod when connected with the computer will begin to charge, which in the use of battery-powered notebook, when the attention of millions of others can be so dry.</p>
<p>5. Add more memory</p>
<p>More memory means that notebooks do not have to be so dependent on virtual memory. Virtual memory is built on the hard drive above, it is clear access memory power consumption is lower, so more memory rather than hard disk reader that can reduce power consumption. However, the increase in the same memory can trigger the issue of energy consumption, so those often called virtual memory computer friends, most of the consider adding memory.</p>
<p>6. A little less drive</p>
<p>Although relatively large hard drive power consumption, but in fact drive more energy consumption eyes. Even when not in use, drive is still the same rotation, consumption of energy. If we can find a suitable virtual CD-ROM files, through a virtual drive to read, obviously much less power consumption.</p>
<p>7. To keep feet clean touch</p>
<p>Suggest all of us here, every few months on the clean-up about the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1078.htm">apple a1078 battery</a> touch metal feet, can be used soiled cloth alcohol wipe. This can guarantee that the battery inside the battery can be more effective to send it to the various components of consumption.</p>
<p>8. A good custody of battery</p>
<p>Custody is not good for you to turn the battery shelved, but regular exercise and check it out. Do not let the battery fully charged, &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; to be a good long time. Once the wires charge, you should at least once every 23 weeks fully used once. Of course, do not let your lithium batteries fully End electricity consumption, it is to deal with the old battery memory effect option.</p>
<p>9. Dormancy rather than standby</p>
<p>Although the standby allows users to immediately return to work status, but this feature is obviously better than sleep to save electricity. Sleep under the same to preserve the status of your current work, and almost complete halt to allow the notebook power consumption.</p>
<p>10. Lower operating temperature</p>
<p>Reduce the number of notebook temperature can be more efficient to run. The use of a longer period of the notebook, the internal will be a considerable degree of dust accumulation, which can allow the work of notebook internal temperature. Regular notebook internal cleaning, for extended <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1078.htm">a1078 battery</a> life is also very important.</p>
<p>11. Optimization of Power Options</p>
<p>In the Windows control panel, there is a Power Options button, the button will be able to set up through this, optimize your notebook&#8217;s power options. There are some more powerful notebook comes with power management software, it is more user-friendly use.</p>
<p>12. Non-multi-tasking</p>
<p>The best time to use the battery only on a mission, rather than changing to deal with statements while in the background to send and receive messages while playing music, etc. &#8230; &#8230; multi-task processing, can only give you the faster the battery consumption, but also which did not finish the work there is no power.</p>
<p>13. Less running large procedures</p>
<p>Extended battery life, the best small amount of heavy tasks to run a big program. Send and receive mail, dealing with electronic documents, it is clear than is necessary to play games, play DVD discs more than a small power consumption.</p>
<p>14. The replacement of new books</p>
<p>To accompany their books for several years is not willing to throw away, but the ruthless fact is: they are already old, already can not keep up the efficiency. Latest notebooks, in the energy consumption side, many of the upgrade, you want longer battery life time, may wish to pick up new love throwing Ningbo.</p>
<p>15. The prevention of memory effect</p>
<p>If your notebook old, it must pay attention to the prevention of &#8220;memory effect&#8221; generated. Every 23 weeks let your <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1078.htm">apple a1078 battery</a> fully charge / discharge time, of course, if you use lithium-ion battery, then there would be no such problems.</p>
<p>16. Shut down automatically saved</p>
<p>Microsoft Word, Excel and other procedures are automatically saved functions, in most cases this is an intimate setting, but in the use of laptop batteries, which adds to the work of the hard disk. Shut down this feature, you need to remember always save the document, the provincial final outcome of hard work go down the drain.</p>
<p>17. Lower graphics applications</p>
<p>For instance, we can change the graphics resolution, the closure of some beautiful and open to the special effects, graphics card is a noteworthy because it is now the card has the power and hard disk is running out, some even higher.</p>
<p>If you use any ideas, experience, skills very much hope that you can recommend to us, to extend the life notebook, notebook users are most concerned about a project.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>(1) the principle of biological photochemical battery</p>
<p>Biological photochemical <a href="http://www.mylaptopbattery.co.uk/dell-c1295.htm">dell C1295 battery</a> by the Department of Biology, biomass or waste of energy resources such as energy, the cost of the smallest. As the only activity able to prototype, and directly in the fuel cell power generation, wave them through cell activation, in the electrode reaction to generate electricity directly. UV is now in the pilot phase of the empirical, the future goal is to visible light is still used to further long-wavelength infrared light is activated. To build a hydrogen fuel cell hydrogen supply base, from a cost and security point of view, is not simple. There are other fuel compounds, such as ammonia as a source of energy used in the way the media sponsors. The safe handling of livestock waste has become the world&#8217;s largest problem, especially nitrogen, is ultimately become the material of ammonia, and its goals have not yet been enacted to deal with, in view of this situation, we should first try to build in order to make a direct ammonia fuel photochemical battery.</p>
<p>Under alkaline conditions, will be holding tam platinum titanium dioxide particles suspended in ammonia solution, using ultra-violet light, so that ammonia decomposition, use 3 / 1 molar ratio, generated H2/N2. Will nanogramme porous titanium and platinum electrodes with a very, soaked in ammonia solution, in acid-free state, to carry out ultra-violet light, the titanium dioxide generated in the N2, with most produce in H2, but in such an occasion, because electromotive force is extremely small, as a light <a href="http://www.mylaptopbattery.co.uk/dell-c1295.htm">C1295 battery</a> has little significance. However, in the case of co-existence of oxygen to light when, because of the negative polarity (cathode) from oxygen reduction reaction, as a biological photochemical cell function, showing that the potential of potential.</p>
<p>2 Department of ammonia solution very BPCC characteristics (1 room type), with 10M ammonia solution, 500W xenon lamp irradiation (light intensity 503mWcm-2), access to open optical electromotive force Voc 0.84V, short-circuit photocurrent Jsc 0.30mAcm-2, curve FF factor of about 0.6. Photocurrent density values because of ultraviolet light speed to become law, it is not too high, photon radiation, the flow ratio of photocurrent, there is no set percentage of the best, at present is probably around 19 percent. UV energy surplus, confirmed ammonia biological role of photosensitive chemical battery.</p>
<p>(2) bio-sensor chemical <a href="http://www.mylaptopbattery.co.uk/dell-c1295.htm">C1295 battery</a> (BPCC) applications.</p>
<p>The use of such light fuel cell, if the biomass and organic matter such as sending body compounds into liquid or deep fluid, as a direct fuel can be converted to electricity. Alcohol (methanol, ethanol) or organic acids, urea, amino acids, sugars such as glucose, both proteins (gelatin, bone gum), polysaccharides (agarose, cellulose), lignin as a natural high molecular compounds can also be used as fuel to generate electricity directly, for example, in ethanol liquid become Voc 0.49V, Jsc 0.52mAcm-2, FF 0.25, its light fuel cell reaction by 1, 2, said.</p>
<p>(Optical anode reaction) C2H5OH +12 h + +3 H2O → 2CO2 +12 H + (1)</p>
<p>(Cathode reaction) 3O2 +12 e-+12 H + → 6H2O (2)</p>
<p>Total C2H5OH +3 O2 +3 H2O → 2CO2 +6 H2O (3)</p>
<p>This reactive EO is 0.084V (VS, SHE), donor sex (Send body) close to H2, ammonia and the same activity of the necessary energy small. Also made it clear the use of thin-type BPCC, in solar simulation, AM1.5, exposure to light intensity 100mWem-2 conditions, with the natural coloring paste solution or uneven natural sample can also generate electricity. If the biomass waste to smash into a paste, when photolysis purification, can also generate electricity, can be contained in the energy to make a direct power recovery.</p>
<p>Sustainable energy resources as biomass and its LCA (Life Cycle) evaluation and use of biological photochemical biomass direct <a href="http://www.mylaptopbattery.co.uk/dell-c1295.htm">dell C1295 laptop battery</a> power. Is currently using ultra-violet light, but the Department of liquid waste biomass, such as the decomposition of purification and at the same time the power is effective in obtaining the use of condensate to be sunlight data at the same time, the visible light of.</p>

<p>Study at home and abroad iron batteries have a high iron and lithium-iron two BYD iron <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell.htm">dell battery</a> appears to be the former, with the exception of BYD apart There is no other manufacturers that their products can be large-scale practical use.</p>
<p>Synthesis of high-iron <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-6y270.htm">dell 6y270 battery</a> is based on the stability of ferrate (K2FeO4, BaFeO4 etc.), can be used as high-speed railway <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-6y270.htm">dell 6y270 battery</a> cathode material to produce energy density, small size, light weight, long life and a new type of non-polluting chemical battery.</p>
<p>Iron battery advantages:</p>
<p>High-energy high-capacity. Currently on the market than the civilian <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-6y270.htm">dell 6y270 battery</a> power only 60-135w/kg, while the high-iron batteries can be achieved 1000w/kg more discharge current is 3-10 times that of ordinary batteries. Particularly suited to the needs of high-power, high current occasion. Cost-effective high-iron battery. Alkaline manganese batteries can not meet the current need of high-current large-capacity power of digital cameras, cameras and other electronic products needs, lithium-ion batteries because of the cost in this regard does not have a strong competitive edge.</p>
<p>High Speed Rail flat <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell.htm">dell battery</a> discharge curve. Such as Zn-K2FeO4, 70% more than the discharge time in the 1.2-1.5V.</p>
<p>Abundant raw materials. The earth&#8217;s crust in the most abundant element for aluminum and iron, iron content in the earth&#8217;s crust is 4.75%, manganese content was 0.088 percent. At the same time every mol +6 valent iron can produce 3mol electronics, while the price of manganese per mol +4 could only produce 1mol electronics, the amount of iron is very rich in their own circumstances, the only Mn 1 / 3, significantly saving on social resources, reduced raw material costs. MnO2 market about 9,000 yuan / ton, Fe (NO3) 3 about 7,500 yuan / ton.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Abstract: In accordance with established liquid feed direct methanol  fuel cell one-dimensional model of methanol penetrating discussion of  the impact on <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1175.htm">battery</a> performance. The results showed that: the current  density is low, methanol penetration of the impact of a larger <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">battery</a>  performance; With the current density increases, methanol penetrating  properties of the battery is getting smaller and smaller. </p>
<p>Key words: direct methanol fuel cell; mathematical model; methanol penetrating; have potential </p>
<p>Key words: 7rM911.4 literature sign code: A Article ID :1008-1267 (2008) 04-0023_03 </p>
<p>Preliminary studies on direct methanol fuel cell set up along the  perpendicular to the direction of proton exchange membrane of  one-dimensional model of coupled equations of the components of the  mass conservation equation, momentum equation and electric conduction  equation. Anodic methanol oxidation kinetics of complex multi-step  reaction mechanism snapped. Model also takes into account methanol  penetration of the cathode reaction of oxygen and thus amended the  parallel response theory. In the pre-published article, a detailed  description of the material in the battery within the concentration  distribution. This paper mainly introduces the cathode, anode potential  distribution have been obtained at different current density of  methanol penetrating impact on battery performance. </p>
<p>1. Have the potential distribution </p>
<p>Can be seen from Figure 1, in the work of the density of smaller  batteries, the cathode potential had been higher than the anode  potential, in the open when there is a high cathode-off potential. This  is because the work when the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/appl.htm">battery</a> current density smaller. For the  anodic reaction of methanol flux is very small, a large number of  methanol penetrate to the cathode catalyst layer oxidation reaction  occurs. The formation of a high penetration of methanol-off potential. </p>
<p>When the battery operating current density (&gt; 475 to cm-2)  when. Anode potential had been greater than the cathode potential. The  reason is that the battery work of larger current density, methanol  penetration flux smaller (Figure 1), methanol had potential to  penetrate smaller. The anodic oxidation kinetics of methanol have been  caused by a greater potential. </p>
<p>When the battery operating current density of 797mA cm-2 when.  Potential increased rapidly over the anode, when the battery is mainly  affected by the anode concentration polarization control. </p>
<p>2 methanol penetrating impact on battery performance </p>
<p>Figure 2 reflects the concentration of methanol feed 2500moL/m3,  oxygen pressure of 1.0 MPa (gauge pressure), batteries work when the  temperature is 80 ℃. Methanol penetrating impact on battery  performance. </p>
<p>Figure 2 ideal battery that there is no methanol penetration of  direct methanol fuel cell (that is, direct methanol proton exchange  membrane can be completely prevented through methanol). </p>
<p>From Figure 2 we can see that when the battery when the current  density of less actual battery performance and the performance  difference between the ideal of a larger battery. With the battery  operating current density, the actual battery performance and the  performance difference between the ideal battery is getting smaller and  smaller. That is, methanol penetrating properties of the battery is  getting smaller and smaller. This is because the work when the battery  current density smaller. For the reaction of methanol is very small,  penetrating to the battery cathode methanol more. In addition, the work  of the battery when the current density smaller. Penetrate to the  cathode of methanol oxidation reactions caused by the internal cathode  current is the main factor had potential. Methanol penetration of the  impact of a larger <a href="http://www.mylaptopbattery.co.uk/apple-a1175.htm">battery</a> performance. With the current density  increases, the amount for the reaction of methanol increased. And  discharge current density is high. Electrode performance by ohmic  polarization control, penetrating to the cathode catalyst layer of  methanol oxidation to form the internal cathode current is not  accounted for the vast majority of total current, thus penetrating  methanol battery performance was less affected. </p>
<p>Figure 3-based model and the cathode catalyst layer response to  the assumption that the establishment of parallel one-dimensional model  of the DMFC battery performance that corresponds to the results of the  comparison. From the figure we can see that when the battery current  density smaller work, the two models have larger differences in battery  performance. The reason is that at this time to the cathode penetrate a  large amount of methanol. Cathode catalyst layer with a higher  concentration of methanol, the cathode catalyst layer for oxygen  reduction reaction activity of the effective surface area decreases,  the existence of cathode methanol oxygen reduction reaction on the  impact of the larger, so the two models have larger differences in  battery performance . </p>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1175.htm">battery</a> work of the current density increases, the two  models of battery performance has been gradually reduced the  difference. This is because the work of the battery current density is  high, to infiltrate into smaller cathode methanol flux. And when  high-current battery-control step in the anode, so the two models of  battery performance to be more nuanced. </p>
<p>Figure 4 pass accounted for the methanol permeability of methanol  percentage of the total flux and current density. At low current  density. Access to most of the anode diffusion layer to the cathode of  methanol as a result of infiltration and wasted. With the current  density increase. Methanol penetrating pass accounted for the total  flux of methanol is getting smaller and smaller proportion. Methanol  penetrating pass accounted for the total flux ratio of methanol as the  reaction of methanol and methanol penetration flux and change. With the  battery operating current density for the reaction of methanol to  increase the total flux. The penetration flux reduced methanol. To the  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1175.htm">battery</a> limits of the work of all the current density of methanol are  used for reaction. Methanol almost no penetration to the battery  cathode catalyst layer, when the reaction of methanol flux equivalent  to the total flux of methanol. </p>
<p>Figure 5 shows the penetration of methanol flux and current  density. Methanol penetration flux with current density increases. When  the current density close to the limit when the current density.  Methanol flux penetration with almost no changes in current density  increase. This is because the current density of methanol penetration  flux reflected in two aspects. On the one hand with the current density  increases, the anode catalyst layer within the more water will drag  effect as a result of electricity through the proton exchange membrane.  On the other hand with the current density increases, methanol in the  reaction of the anode catalyst layer consumption increased penetration  of water had membrane carried by decreasing the concentration of  methanol. </p>
<p>3. Conclusion </p>
<p>3.1 in the low current density. Access to most of the anode  diffusion layer to the cathode of methanol as a result of infiltration  and wasted. Methanol penetration of the impact of a larger battery  performance. </p>
<p>3.2 With the current density increases battery life. For the  reaction of methanol to increase the total flux, and the methanol  penetration flux reduced to battery current density limit the work of  all of methanol are used for reaction, almost no methanol penetrate to  the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1175.htm">battery</a> cathode catalyst layer. Methanol penetration of battery  performance was less affected.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>BY: fsacj, <em>NotebookReview.com Contributor</em></p>
<p>PUBLISHED: 3/19/2006</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-e1505.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Inspiron e1505</strong></a>  is Dells 15.4&#8243; widescreen notebook featuring the impressive new Intel Core Duo CPU.  A virtually identical <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Inspiron 6400</strong></a> is available through their business site.  Outside it looks just like the Inspiron 6000 it replaces, but the new hardware inside makes for impressive performance.  In traditional Dell style, the E1505 is well rounded, quite customizable and available at a competitive price, but doesn&#8217;t offer anything radical.</p>
<p><strong>The E1505 reviewed here was configured as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core Duo Processor T2500 at 2.0 GHz per core.</li>
<li>15.4&#8243; Ultrasharp SXGA+ display with TrueLife</li>
<li>512MB DDR2 533MHz RAM in dual channel mode</li>
<li>Integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950</li>
<li>100GB 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive</li>
<li>8X DVD +/- dual layer recorder</li>
<li>53 watt-hour 6-cell battery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Build and Design</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-e1505.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Inspiron e1505</strong></a> matches much of the Dell lineup clad in painted silver with white trim on top and a black underside.  I&#8217;m not a fan of painted finishes because they seem more susceptible to chips and scratches.  The color scheme is simple, but I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the white trim &#8220;bumpers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The notebook is sturdy enough to feel comfortable lifting it by one corner.  However, I would like better overall build quality.  It is comparable to Sony and others but does not come near the solid (and expensive) IBM ThinkPad line.  Just like my Inspiron 9300, there is a gap at the bottom of the LCD.  This area also gets quite warm.  It must be where the LCD backlight or inverter is.  I wonder if the gap is purposeful to allow some heat to escape.</p>
<p><strong>Heat:</strong></p>
<p>After about two hours of DVD watching, both sides of the palm rest became warm, but not at all hot.  The keyboard and area under the screen generated more heat.  The underside of the notebook was also slightly warm at the front and warmer, but not hot at the rear.  As with all notebooks, heat is more of an issue when used on an insulating/air-restricting lap.  Running heavier tasks does not generate noticeably more heat.  The computer will cool down almost as if it were off if allowed to sit idle for 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong></p>
<p>With the smaller option <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk">6 cell battery</a> and a powerful new processor, I didn&#8217;t have very high hopes for battery life.  However, the Dell lasted longer than expected.  At maximum brightness, it played a DVD for 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Under normal light tasks, with WiFi on and almost maximum brightness, the battery lasted almost three hours.  Dimming the screen all the way and shutting wireless off squeezed almost 4 hours of total battery life.  I could burn the battery in about 90 minutes or less if I really tried.  Gaming would likely burn it this fast. </p>
<p>The optional <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell.htm">9-cell battery</a>, which is the same physical size as the 6-cell, should give about 50% more run time.</p>
<p>The battery charges fast for the first 80%.  At nearly 1% per minute, you could get a significant boost on a one hour layover at the airport.</p>
<p>A bigger battery might be a better choice than two batteries.  Lithium-Ion cells wear out even if you don&#8217;t use them.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Dell Inspiron 6400 Review (Canada)  See all <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">Laptop Battery</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">Dell Inspiron 6400</a> (also sold as the Inspiron e1505 via <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell.htm">Dell Home</a>) is a laptop that meets you in the middle&#8217;. It&#8217;s pretty light and portable (like the Inspiron e1405) and offers high performance and great media options (like the Inspiron e1705). Basically, you get the best of both worlds, at a reasonable price. Before we begin reviewing anything, here are the specs of my system:</p>
<p>Intel Core Duo T2400 / 5 Mb Cache / 1.83 GHz / 667 MHZ FSB</p>
<p>15.4&#8243; Wide-screen XGA Display with Truelife</p>
<p>120 Gb 5400 rpm Sata Hard Drive</p>
<p>1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM / 553 MHZ</p>
<p>256 Mb ATI Mobility Radeon X1400 Hyper memory</p>
<p>Windows XP Media Center</p>
<p>9 &#8211; Cell Battery</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reasons for Buying</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">Dell Inspiron 6400 </a>really interested me because it had everything I needed for the price that I wanted. It&#8217;s small and light enough to carry (even with the 9-cell) and is powerful enough for my needs. I chose Dell because of their quality, in my mind. I&#8217;ve only bought one Desktop, the Dell Dimension 8200. 6 years later, it&#8217;s still running incredibly well with Windows XP (designed for Windows ME). Anyways, I was confident that the laptop I was about to purchase will last me a long time, and I have plenty reasons.</p>
<p>Where &amp; How it Was Purchased</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I ordered my laptop on Dell&#8217;s Canadian website. I found that the site was fairly easy to navigate and didn&#8217;t get lost too often. Dell&#8217;s main advantage over their competitors is that laptops they sell are always highly configurable. Unfortunately, I had some credit card problems that were beyond my control, so my order was delayed. The sales representative was very polite and assisted me throughout the process. I got my laptop in 15 days. It would normally take about 10 days. Overall, I was pleased with the order process and order tracking is very helpful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Build &amp; Design</p>
<p>The Inspiron 6400 feels very sturdy. It doesn&#8217;t feel flimsy, and doesn&#8217;t look like things are going to get loose anytime soon. Opening and closing of the screen is not too loose or too tight. One hand is sufficient enough to move the screen, provided the notebook itself on a stable surface.</p>
<p>The notebook design itself is slightly above average. The silver paint looks very appealing, but not when combined with the white bumpers. I didn&#8217;t really like the bumpers, but I guess it looks decent. Overall this laptop can&#8217;t compare to the XPS series, but its design is good enough to catch some eyes.</p>
