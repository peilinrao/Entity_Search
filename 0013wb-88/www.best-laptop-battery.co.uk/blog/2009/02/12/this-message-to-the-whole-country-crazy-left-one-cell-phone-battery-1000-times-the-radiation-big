                    <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;To drink Milk-Tea less, just do not eat baked bread, far away from the charging power supply, cell phone battery not left one cell phone, left one cell when the radiation is usually a thousand times, but also remember to answer the phone by left ear with the right ear will be directly hurt the brain &#8230; &#8230; &#8220;Yesterday morning, Mr. Wang came to public office, just on the QQ instant messaging software, computer pop-up screen on a friend&#8217;s message. After reading the contents, Mr. Wang could not help but smoke down a mouthful of air-conditioners: Because the contents of the warning above, almost all have experienced him.</p>
<p>The health warning message through QQ, MSN software or phone message forwarding crazy and become popular with the major web-based forum. Many users would prefer to believe that it has no credible. In this regard, Changsha City, the health of health care professionals, life science experts said that should not do the whole copy, and should select the essence and dross removed.</p>
<p>Events: a warning message to be transmitted crazy</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said, not only have received this message, when their message read this article to listen to colleagues, most of them are aware that some cell phone message received, while others are transmitted through MSN. The earliest in September this year, my colleagues saw. Mr. Wang will this short message transmitted to the QQ on the dozens of friends, some netizens also answered &#8220;I have long heard about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can honestly say that I make inside the basic one not to do; rather than to do, and I have almost all experienced. In particular, &#8216;left one cell phone battery when not to call, left one cell when radiation is the usual One thousand times&#8217; of this, almost every few days will be encountered first, will impact on the body? &#8221;</p>
<p>User: prefer to believe its not have credible</p>
<p>Not just mobile phones and QQ, MSN, yesterday, the reporter through Baidu inquiries, which can enter the word, you can see this information has been short lived in the major sites, and message information overwhelming. Because human nature is full of care, the contents of &#8220;alternative&#8221; between words with warm greetings, they blog on mobile phones and also started to reproduce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say good health on the life bit by bit.&#8221; According to friends of the message, the reporter found that the majority of netizens expressed their willingness to believe that the contents of this message, many users have to keep in good health as a book, while others are &#8220;better letter its has its non-credible. &#8221; User has also raised doubts that such an argument it is difficult to find the basis of life that should be natural and unrestrained, &#8220;according to live this way, too detailed, but also tired, individuals are not respected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Message content</p>
<p>This network of peers who were regarded as &#8220;health guidelines,&#8221; says: &#8220;喝奶茶less, just do not eat baked bread, far away from the charging power supply, cutting the evening of the day drink plenty of water a day, do not drink more than two cups of coffee , less oil and more food, the best sleep for 22 o&#8217;clock to six o&#8217;clock in the morning, after 5:00 p.m. less eat a big meal a day, no more than a cup of drink, do not have cold water suits capsules before going to bed half an hour taking bogey lying immediately under. sleep less than eight hours a person will become stupid, people have the habit of napping old is not easy. handset battery left not one cell phone, left one cell when the radiation is usually a thousand times, but also remember to answer the phone by left ear, with the right ear will be directly hurt the brain, seen on the transponder to every friend you cherish!!! the cold weather, warm attention, too busy to remember their love! &#8221;</p>
<p>Expert Interpretation</p>
<p>Tip the contents of most of them can not be sure</p>
<p>The spread time of up to six months, almost all kinds of communication channels to occupy the &#8220;Health Guidelines&#8221; Is there any scientific basis for it? Yesterday, 6 had successful prediction Nobel Prize winner, Life Sciences, Hunan Normal University Professor Wang Shenli of message on mobile phone radiation have been interpreted in part. Professor said: &#8221; &#8216;answer the phone by left ear with the right ear will be directly harmful to the brain&#8217; is absolutely wrong, and the remaining contents of some may believe, and some should be treated carefully, because I myself heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obstetrics and gynecology, director of the Hunan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital physicians Jinming Howard specifically for pregnant women dietary guidance, as health care professionals, she give pregnant women a variety of life living standards higher than the general population, her message on diet and sleep parts the interpretation, at the same time to remind readers not to be misled some of the elements, not to incorrectly relay an erroneous message.</p>
<p>Less milk-tea </p>
<p>Credibility ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Drink some tea with milk is appropriate, but should not drink, mainly contains a lot of sugar, saturated fatty acids and other substances, especially for pregnant women, they should eat less sweets; and tea for diabetic patients is unfavorable. In addition, we advocate is best not to drink coffee, eat less oil and more food, after 5:00 p.m. less eat a big meal is correct.</p>
<p>Just do not eat bread baked</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Guide specifically for pregnant women diet, we did not emphasize that we should not eat just baked bread, it is not credible. Generally speaking, the temperature of imported food should be capable of sustaining the people&#8217;s mouth for the appropriate. Temperature too high on the oral and esophageal food adversely affected. Just do not eat bread baked in nutrition that there is no exact theoretical basis, but other barbecue food harmful to human health, or to eat less.</p>
<p>During the day and drink plenty of water at low water</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
<p>The promotion of the evening should not be drinking plenty of water, mainly because the water at night will increase the number to get up to go to the washroom, the impact of rest, drink plenty of water but the amount is still necessary. &#8220;No more than a glass of alcohol a day&#8221;, here the &#8220;Cup&#8221; to the quantitative, and because of wine but rather one. Beer generally divided into 350 milliliters (equivalent to one vial of the volume of mineral water), red wine, 150 milliliters, 30 milliliters of white wine is better.</p>
<p>Capsules do not have cold water service</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Promote service capsule with warm water. Because the cold water may stimulate the esophagus, while the water is overheating will melt capsule in advance.</p>
<p>Best sleep 22:00-6:00</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>At present, the best definition of sleep is the sleep quality standards, rather than sleep time. For each individual, because the different habits, different clock, the best sleep time will be difficult standardized.</p>
<p>Less than eight hours of sleep will become stupid</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Lack of sleep will lead to the body&#8217;s nervous system should not rest, will affect the thinking of agility, but it will not make变笨. And sleep time should reach a few hours, there is no quantitative, rest can be enough.</p>
<p>Have nap habits were difficult to Old</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Have the habit of napping with aging are not necessarily linked. However, napping can add energy, so that the whole afternoon energetic.</p>
<p>Battery left one cell do not call</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Strong place in the signal to call and place in the weak signal call, the radiation level on the human body is not the same as, the former small, and the latter because the weaker signal when the phone&#8217;s transmitter signal the greater the power. Similarly, cell phone battery when the phone call left one, radiation certainly adequate electricity than when larger. But not a thousand times, however, await the research. However, it is noteworthy that the moment the phone connected to the relative strength of radiation, it is proposed to connect not just to answer the call immediately.</p>
<p>Away from the charging power supply</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Low-voltage power transformers with the surrounding magnetic field does exist, but not high. Day-to-day access voltage is only 220 volts, converted by the transformer would be even lower, around the magnetic field does exist, but should not harm the human body.</p>
<p>With the right ear to the brain will hurt</p>
<p>Credibility ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Then use the left ear phones, the radiation received is smaller than the right ear, the electromagnetic wave is spread on all sides, around the ear with the phone effect is the same, there is no right to answer the call the issue of brain injury. This point of no scientific conclusions, but best not to put the phone near the left side of the heart of the location of T-shirt pocket.</p>
