                    <div class="entry-content"><p>2.3.3 Valve periodic battery maintenance measures</p>
<p>2.3.3.1 are regularly recharged. Charging pressure are used 2 35V / monomer ± 0 02V. Every three months to 6 months should have one charge times should be normal float voltage difference depending on the extent to decide. Both the charging time is generally 8 ~ 12h. The purpose of a regular basis are charging are: the elimination of temperature changes without a timely amendment to float voltage change; battery float voltage regular discharge but should not the stipulated period of time sufficient for its electricity.</p>
<p>2.3.3.2 periodic amendments to the battery float voltage value system</p>
<p>Because of the battery float voltage value system influenced by temperature, so the battery system should be based on the use of ambient temperature changes in a timely amendment of the charging voltage value system. Annually adjust the general settings 2 ~ 4 times. Adjust the standard as follows: the ambient temperature increased by 1 ℃, the lower the float voltage 0 003V / monomer; ambient temperature every 1 ℃ lower, the higher float voltage 0 003V / monomer. Battery operation in high-temperature environment (greater than 30 ℃), because of the battery internal resistance become smaller, more efficient battery charging, battery capacity will increase. Therefore appropriate to reduce充充电float voltage value, reducing the float current, battery capacity is not affected. When the battery is running low ambient temperature (20 ℃ below), the battery inside the lead sulfate solubility and dissolution rate of lower electrolyte concentration polarization increases at the same time by the electrolyte resistivity increase caused by the change of the battery internal resistance, so the requirements in low-temperature conditions have a higher charge voltage, in order to meet the charging requirements. Otherwise it will create less than the phenomenon of charge.</p>
<p>2.3.3.3 regularly check discharge test</p>
<p>A post-mortem at a floating battery system of long-term work, because of the excessive negative electrode active material composite design and the existence of oxygen, resulting in negative plates have a part of the total active material in less than a state of charge, but also because of the long-term float current and not enough to make a very small board within the active substances are fully electrochemical reaction caused by the internal electrode active material sulfation, thereby reducing the capacity of negative electrode plates so that battery life be affected. To avoid these phenomena, for the long-term job in a floating state of the battery charging system should be different depending on the status of job to take every 6 months or 12 months to check one times of discharge test. When the 6 months one time when the discharge depth of discharge can be more shallow, should adopt the 30% ~ 40%, if 12 months may be appropriate when discharge test some better advised to 50% ~ 60%, in-depth understanding will be easily observed battery system breakdown monomer battery.</p>
<p>3 Concluding remarks</p>
<p>In short, the VRLA battery maintenance is very important, according to valve-regulated lead-acid batteries of different characteristics, in view of the impact of VRLA battery life of the main factors, and continuously improve the level of maintenance to enhance the purpose of life to improve the operation of substation DC system reliability, to ensure the safe operation of power grids.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>1.3 the impact of the unbalanced nature of the charge-discharge</p>
<p>The study results show that: different parts of grid alloy composition and structure of the distribution are different, and thus grid will lead to the unbalanced nature of the electrochemical performance, which in turn is the unbalanced nature of the floating charge and charge and discharge state voltage difference, and as the charge, discharge cycle, so that this difference increasing to form a so-called &#8220;behind the battery (battery failure).&#8221; At present, the standards require, in one group of the largest battery float voltage difference should be ≤ 50mV, while developed countries are the standard ≤ 20mV, so should pay attention to and reduce the floating state of the battery operating voltage differences.</p>
<p>1.4 thermal runaway phenomenon</p>
<p>VRLA battery because of the use of depleted fluid design, battery electrolyte perfusion are adsorbed on glass fiber, when the charge current increases, on the adoption of necessary safety valve to release gas, resulting in the battery water loss, resistance by large capacity fading and filling, discharge process a large number of calories, such as time to the proliferation of these heat related to temperature increase, will lead to thermal runaway. Thermal runaway causes are not promptly reduce the float voltage, lax safety valve or open valve pressure is too low and so on, in hot severe cases out of control if the discharge, it is possible to make batteries and battery voltage sag moment shell temperature rose to 70 ~ 80 ℃, and therefore thermal runaway problem should elicit a high degree of attention.</p>
<p>VRLA battery 2 Operation and Maintenance</p>
<p>In response to the above affect the service life of VRLA battery factor analysis, in order to improve the service life of VRLA batteries, we must do the following.</p>
<p>2.1 strict quality</p>
<p>In battery selection and procurement process, it is necessary to fully understand the manufacturer&#8217;s production process, manufacturing process and quality control tools, as well as technical characteristics and, if necessary, may require manufacturers to carry out the first time in the capacity of experiments to screen a smaller battery difference.</p>
<p>2.2 reasonable charging equipment selection</p>
<p>For valve-regulated lead-acid battery charging equipment selection, the appropriate selection of high-quality high-frequency switching power supply or control power, the ripple coefficient, precision regulator, steady flow of key indicators such as accuracy requirements should be higher and should have real-time monitoring and intelligent management capabilities that will enable sealed battery at all times the best job in the state. For high-frequency switching power supply module when there is failure, should be able to immediately quit running and do not affect the normal operation of other modules to ensure the battery module failures do not cause over-discharge.</p>

<p>Figure 1 describes the battery pack in the application circuit. According to the monitoring of the use of battery power IC of different battery pack will have at least 3-4 external terminal can be used.</p>
<p>Figure 1 A typical application circuit</p>
<p>VCC and BAT pin to access the battery voltage for the IC power and battery voltage measurements. A low resistance sense resistor to be installed in the battery ground terminal, so that both ends of the sense resistor can be battery voltage monitoring of high-impedance input SRP and SRN to monitor. Current flows through the sense resistor will help us to determine the volume of the battery has been recharged or discharge volume. In the choice of sense resistor value, the designers must take into account its two ends of the voltage should not exceed 100mV. The resistance value is too small at low current conditions may lead to error. Circuit board layout must ensure that the SRP and SRN to sensing resistor connection as close as possible the various endpoint sensing resistor; that Kelvin connection measurement.</p>
<p>HDQ / SDA and SCL pins are open-drain devices, both require an external pull-up resistor. This resistor should be located on the host side or on the side of the main application so that the battery monitoring function of sleep in the battery pack and portable devices can be activated after disconnect. Recommend pull-resistor value of 10kΩ.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Lithium &#8211; manganese dioxide battery characteristics:</p>
<p>1, relatively low price of: manganese dioxide cathode active material the use of electrolytic manganese dioxide, a lithium battery cathode active material of a relatively low-cost, large scale application.</p>
<p>2, battery electric performance: its specific energy batteries are of the 5 ~ 10 times (about 230Wh/kg or 500Wh / L), load voltage of 2.8V, relatively stable discharge voltage. Can be -40 ~ 50 ℃ in the scope of work;</p>
<p>3, long-life battery storage: at room temperature under the condition of the battery storage life of more than 10 years, the annual capacity of about 1 percent lower;</p>
<p>4, safe and reliable battery: the battery in the storage and discharge without gas precipitation process, security is good;</p>
<p>5, the battery a wide variety: batteries including button, column, rectangular three categories, each category there are different size and structure of the battery capacity from dozens to hundreds of milliamperes range when Simon. Therefore meet the requirements of a variety of applications.</p>
<p>The development of lithium &#8211; manganese dioxide battery research significance</p>
<p>Because of lithium &#8211; manganese dioxide battery system using non-aqueous organic electrolyte, at low temperature viscosity, conductivity dropped, resulting in Li-Mn02 batteries at low temperature only a small power output, even in battery design structural change, still can not essentially improve low temperature performance of the battery system. This has seriously hampered the system in the civilian fields. However, because of lithium &#8211; sulfur dioxide batteries and lithium &#8211; thionyl acid battery, with the storage time, the increase in output current and the use of lower ambient temperature in the electrode surface to form dense passive film, resulting in the use of battery and there will be obvious voltage lags behind, according to different time lag may be as long as ten minutes, in addition there are two types of battery safety problem: lithium &#8211; thionyl chloride battery system, when the battery caused by improper use of the battery temperature increases, the product of sulfur cathode discharge exothermic reaction occurred and lithium, or lithium-carbon inserts may have with thionyl chloride or sulfur intense exothermic reaction occurred in the battery system makes the security less; lithium &#8211; sulfur dioxide battery system itself exist internal pressure, when the battery misconduct will result in explosion or sulfur dioxide gas leak, there is security problem worse. The United States has been the use of lithium &#8211; sulfur dioxide batteries and lithium &#8211; thionyl chloride batteries appear to endanger the physical safety incidents reported, with the twenty-first century there is growing attention to environmental protection and system safe and reliable, so the safety of lithium-good &#8212; dioxide battery system, further study will be the first lithium battery research.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Figure 4 is a battery temperature of 353 K, humidification temperature of 333 K, current density of 1.08 A/cm2, the cathode catalyst layer of the impedance distribution. Map can be seen along the direction of the gas channel, impedance lower. Electrochemical reaction to generate because of the water channel in the direction of gas accumulation, so that moisture content gradually improve, reduce the proton transfer resistance. Catalyst layer from the diffusion layer of proton exchange membrane side to side, reduce the impedance. Mainly because it is near the proton exchange membrane side of the high-speed electrochemical reaction to generate many of the water, proton exchange membrane components in higher water content, lower resistance to proton transfer.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>Figure 5 is a battery heating temperature 353 K, humidification temperature of 333K, current density of 1.08 A/cm2, the cathode catalyst layer temperature distribution. Map can be seen: in the gas-channel direction, temperature is gradually reduced. The main reason is the oxygen volume fraction and effective porosity reduced, resulting in reduced speed of electrochemical reaction. Catalyst layer from the diffusion layer of proton exchange membrane side to side temperature. The main reason is the near side of proton exchange membrane, the proton concentration of large, high-speed electrochemical reaction resulting in a higher temperature.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>3 Conclusion</p>
<p>(1) in a simulated known conditions, the proton transfer is the cathode catalyst layer mass transfer control process;</p>
<p>(2) the direction along the gas channel, cathode catalyst layer of oxygen concentration, temperature, impedance and current density were gradually reduced;</p>
<p>(3) from the diffusion layer side to the side of proton exchange membrane, catalyst layer of oxygen volume fraction, temperature and impedance to reduce, and the current density increased.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>2 Simulation Results and Discussion</p>
<p>Simulation of PEM fuel cells are an effective area of 5cm2 of the monomer, DC market. Finite volume method to solve the model equations and their boundary conditions. Table 1 are the model of the PEM fuel cell involves the basic parameters.</p>
<p>        </p>
<p>Figure 2 are in the cathode and anode humidification temperature of 333 K, current density of 1.08A/cm2, the cathode catalyst layer of oxygen distribution. As can be seen along the direction of air flow, oxygen volume fraction on the decline, mainly because of oxygen consumed in the cathode due. In the vertical, the catalyst layer from the gas diffusion layer interface to the proton exchange membrane interface, the oxygen volume fraction lower. This is like that in the cathode catalyst layer of oxygen concentration are uneven, the electrochemical reaction rate is also uneven.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Figure 3 is a humidification temperature of 333 K, average current density of cathode catalyst layer 1.08A/cm2 when the current density distribution. As can be seen from the graph: the direction along the gas channel, the current density gradually reduced. Catalyst layer near the spread from near the proton exchange membrane, current density increased. This is because in this direction, the proton mass fraction increased electrochemical reaction caused by speed. This also indicates when the battery temperature of 353 K, humidification temperature of 333 K, the proton transfer is the cathode in the process of mass transfer control process.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Battery refers to chemical energy, solar energy, atomic energy and other forms of energy can be transformed into a device. It is divided into a battery (commonly known as dry-cell batteries) and the secondary battery (rechargeable battery can be repeated), with technological advances and development of the battery has experienced from the very beginning of the PV cell to the nickel-cadmium batteries, nickel metal hydride batteries, lithium batteries (including lithium batteries and lithium polymer batteries) and the development of the fuel cells. Every technological innovation not only in battery capacity, weight, ease of use of the area has major breakthrough, but also becoming more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>If the laptop CPU is the brain, then the notebook batteries laptop is no doubt that the energy source &#8211; the heart. Laptop of the main features of the &#8220;mobile computing&#8221; will depend on this small battery to provide. Laptop battery has undergone several generations of development, regardless of its size, capacity and type have been tremendous changes have taken place. Each leap all laptop and notebook batteries have a great relationship, but the manufacturers seem to have overlooked this aspect of publicity, with the result that users of the notebook is very important part of little concern, but also lead to users of laptop battery is also less awareness of it less. In the laptop in the main are the use of repeated recharging nickel-cadmium, nickel hydrogen, lithium batteries, but lithium batteries are the main course.</p>

<p>The use of such light fuel cell, if the biomass and organic matter as the sender of compounds into a body fluid or deep fluid, as a direct fuel can be converted to electricity. Ethanol (methanol, ethanol) or organic acids, urea, amino acids, sugars such as glucose, both proteins (gelatin, gum bone), polysaccharides (agarose, cellulose), lignin as a natural high molecular compounds can also be used as direct fuel for power generation, for example, in ethanol liquid become Voc 0.49V, Jsc 0.52mAcm-2, FF 0.25, its light fuel cell reaction by the following type 1, type 2 express.</p>
<p>(Optical anode reaction) C2H5OH +12 h + +3 H2O → 2CO2 +12 H + (1)</p>
<p>(Cathode reaction) 3O2 +12 e-+12 H + → 6H2O (2)</p>
<p>Total C2H5OH +3 O2 +3 H2O → 2CO2 +6 H2O (3)</p>
<p>This reactive EO are 0.084V (VS, SHE), donor sex (send body) close to H2, ammonia and the same activity of the necessary energy small. Also made it clear the use of thin-layer type BPCC, simulated in the sun, AM1.5, irradiation light intensity 100mWem-2 conditions, with the natural coloring paste solution or uneven natural sample may also be generating. If the biomass waste to smash into a paste, photolysis purification, it can simultaneously generate electricity, can be contained in the energy to make a direct power recovery.</p>
<p>As a sustainable energy resources, biomass and its LCA (Life Cycle) evaluation and use of biological photochemical biomass direct battery power. At present, ultra-violet light are used, but the liquid waste biomass, such as the decomposition of the Department of purification and at the same time the power is effective in obtaining the use of condensate sunlight data to be simultaneously carried out of visible light.</p>
