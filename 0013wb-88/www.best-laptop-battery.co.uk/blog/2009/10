                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, scientists have demonstrated the magnitude of a number of micro-fuel cell. The battery via the decay of radioactive elements in the same position to generate energy.<br />
Researchers have introduced the decomposition of radioactive substances, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a>  it will release charged particles if these particles can be collected, will be able to generate electricity. In fact, because the nuclear storage battery energy rich enough (its content is the overall responsibility for the standard battery of 1 million times), there had long been in the military and aerospace fields to be applied, but these batteries nuclear header block to show nuclear battery. University of Missouri research team has invented the pocket this size fuel cell.<br />
The reason why the development of the University of micro fuel cell is intended to reduce the size of electronic devices inside the power supply, making it more suitable for small devices (such as micro-or nano electromechanical -electromechanical systems), because such equipment itself is small enough, there must be a smaller power supply matched. Therefore, development of micro-power and the development of micro-engine itself is equally important.<br />
For a lot of equipment, fuel cells are very interesting, because the radioactive isotopes can provide a powerful stream of electricity, and they are extremely durable, the use of time is usually up to several hundreds years or more. Thus, in space exploration, fuel cells have become the ideal choice. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d620.htm">dell d620 battery</a>  However, in the land, because the volume is too great, but they could be a fuel cell can play full.<br />
University of Missouri, the research team set out by the right of 10000 (Jae Wan Kwon), headed by the professor. The course of their study using a semi-conductive liquid to capture and use of the decay of charged particles. However, most available fuel cells are used in semiconductor solid state. The disadvantage is that the latter energy contained in alleviating the burden is extremely rich, solid semi-conductive state in time will be some damage. This means that if you want to create the life of the battery even with a radioactive isotope, it must be placed in the battery as much as possible in the semiconductor solid state. Consequently, the greater the volume of the battery.<br />
The fees are set, Professor why she uses semiconductor liquids, because the load in high power semiconductor liquids will not cause harm to it, so can greatly save the semiconductor space occupied. Currently, researchers are working to promote the battery of a &#8220;mini-oriented.&#8221;<br />
To allay public anxiety about the safety of nuclear fuel, the researchers explained that although the success of the entire battery depends on whether the use of radioactive substances, but in normal working conditions, the &#8216;use is completely safe. From the right says: &#8220;Most people are scared at the mention of nuclear talks, and I think anyone associated with the nuclear substance is very dangerous. But we must not overlook the fact that many devices have been safe and successful application of nuclear energy, such as pacemakers, space satellites, operating system underwater. &#8220;</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>In the double pressure of energy and the environment, global automakers will look towards a new energy vehicles, huge sums of money for technical research &amp; D and marketing applications. Among them, cell vehicles to hydrogen fuel as an energy source has been one of development. Recently, however, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a>  Automotive Engineering, Tsinghua University and Development Research Institute, Mr. Song Jian, Vice-President stressed that the high cost of vehicle fuel cell, hydrogen is difficult, the technology of fuel cells for development of new energy vehicles does not seem practical.<br />
Deficient in several respects:<br />
The high cost of vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell is difficult<br />
Vehicle fuel cell operating principle is: always sent by the fuel cell hydrogen fuel and oxygen under the influence of the catalyst in water while producing electricity driven generator to drive the wheels turning. Although this new energy vehicles emit virtually zero, but due Song, costs are high, restricting future development of hydrogen is difficult.<br />
&#8220;Fuel cell in the car can not replace anything, just a device for converting energy, is equivalent to the rising cost of cars.&#8221; Song said: &#8220;The current generation technology of fuel cells, the price per kilowatt-General to $ 20,000 U.S.. Even in 2035 before the older generation, but also the price per kilowatt of about 20,000 yuan. &#8220;total cost of more expensive vehicles, one year for use during the Olympics, no large-scale production of fuel cell version of the Passat, for example, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-e1505.htm">dell e1505 battery</a>  the cost may be nearly one million yuan each. &#8220;Vehicle fuel cell is still in the &#8216;Run Model&#8217; State, at home and abroad are not mass production. &#8220;Said Song.<br />
In addition to manufacturing costs are high, the hydrogen is also difficult for low-cost access to one of the problems encountered. Song said: &#8220;At this hydrogen by electrolysis of water: the acquisition, use a high cost. Because it is gas, there is a huge and difficult, it is difficult to store and transport. And even in the small spark of static electricity can easily ignite under, there are a security risk. &#8221;<br />
Best Uses:<br />
The most appropriate storage of solar wind<br />
The technology of fuel cells for the development of new energy vehicles does not seem practical. But Song made, using similar techniques to construct the station energy storage power, stabilize the voltage, frequency, regulate peak electricity and the valley, but it added a good choice.<br />
&#8220;Wind energy, solar energy by the excellent weather conditions and volatile output, if they are directly integrated into the grid, would damage the quality of food.&#8221; He explained, &#8220;it would better as a fuel conversion device cells, wind energy, energy issues Solar Electric in situ electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen, then through the fuel cell to generate the electricity. it would lead to the voltage stability of power, frequency stability,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-pavilion-dv9000.htm">hp dv9000 battery</a>  and better suited to enter the gate. when hydrogen becomes a storage medium for energy. &#8221;<br />
Song also said that, initially designed for generators to power fuel cell car, has the characteristics of fast start, can not simply be used to adjust peak and valley. Consumption in the trough, to ensure energy efficiency, excess capacity may be the first store. Wait until rush hour, just 12 seconds of time, fuel cells can bring electricity to be released.<br />
As the current high cost of fuel cells and abroad have not used it as an attempt of energy storage power plants.<br />
New energy cars:<br />
Hybrid is not enough People First<br />
So all kinds of vehicles in which new energy development in the future? In this regard, Song believes that the prospect of a better hybrid.<br />
He said that pure electric vehicles are powered by the vehicle power supply, rely solely on battery power, while leading the process emissions to zero, but very expensive, if long distance travel, the charge is not very practical. The bio-fuel vehicles do not have universal significance, the system needs to take the use of ethanol fuel from corn, soybeans and other crops could cause a food crisis. In contrast, the hybrid technology in foreign countries has matured. It will save over 40% of fuel consumption, 6.2-liter engine consumption of fuel amounts to only 3 liters of fuel consumption average.<br />
However, this song has also stressed that despite the prospect of a good hybrid, but for now, for the average consumer is still very wasteful. He remembered that the GUI for calculating the price of hybrid vehicles that average savings of 1 million dollars, also the equivalent of 7 million yuan. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">sony bps2 battery</a>   Even if the oil price of 7 yuan per liter for the calculation, it can buy 70,000 yuan 10,000 liters of gasoline, enough for passenger cars and 130,000 -15 thousand miles. If you put a one-time purchase of a car so even if the fuel hybrid high yield of 40%, still need to take 60% of the fuel load.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>With the electric vehicle technology and infrastructure components in place quickly, the firm provides market research as a key component prices car battery may be halved within five years, but the <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a>  materials bottlenecks may also be the electrification of vehicles on the road barriers.<br />
Motor Show in Frankfurt, Germany (IAA motor show) during the period, the analyst market analyst CSM Greg Mount, expects the current crisis facing the automotive industry will be a temporary phenomenon; In 2010, demand is expected to become stable, the vehicle of global annual sales amount is expected to grow by 6%. Mount noted that the European car market, but the pace of recovery will be slower in 2010, the projected growth rates of 5%, about the performance of the U.S. market will be better than the overall average growth.<br />
In electric cars and plug-in hybrid market, CSM is necessary to establish a certain size must meet the six critical conditions, they are: high oil prices, charging station infrastructure, government incentives, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-e1505.htm">dell e1505 battery</a>  the ability to offer products and restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide regulations. Most of the above conditions, I&#8217;m afraid to go to 2024-2030 years before reaching maturity; For the current concern about the most relevant manufacturers of lithium electric vehicles, battery technology ion should move towards maturity between 2017-2023 years.<br />
But while lithium was regarded as the standard technology for electric vehicle applications, its high price was considered the development of the electric vehicle industry, a major obstacle on the road. If the predictions of CSM is correct, that is, industry will quickly bring down the price of lithium batteries for automotive, Andrew Fulbrook, senior analyst at the agency in 2015, the 25 kWh Li -ion batteries will be divided into five, and its downward trend in prices will be continued until 2030.<br />
Fulbrook noted that the current price of lithium per kWh is about 1000 euros (1480 dollars), and its key point should be to lower the price of 400 euros per kWh: &#8220;We believe that the price level will be removed acceptance by the market is a key trigger points to strong demand. &#8220;At this stage, 25 kWh Li-ion batteries <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4812a.htm">hp f4812a battery</a>  is then defined as the industry standard size,&#8221; This will be the majority of the first generation electric vehicles used in standard battery sizes. &#8220;Said Fulbrook.<br />
Trends in standardization size battery will help OEM factories in the first phase of efforts to reduce costs, rather than to extend the battery running remotely. Fulbrook said that the 100 ~ 150 km drive from the first generation of electric vehicles will be essential, however: &#8220;the price is more important than driving distance, consumers were not yet ready to spend more of money to extend the travel distance or the battery charge related costs ─ ─ even if a government incentive policies are unnecessary.<br />
Outside the 25 kWh battery, the battery area should also be established there are other price / capacity for significant breakthroughs. Those in the industry say, 30 kWh battery is 2020 euro per 200 kWh price level, while in the U.S. market, 40 kWh batteries should arrive in 2030, for every kW / 100 ~ 120 euro price points .<br />
To reach the price of car battery to ensure supply of raw materials not affect the battery is a major premise; Fulbrook said that mines lithium present are mainly grown in South America,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1061.htm">apple a1061 battery</a> Argentina and Bolivia, China also has many mineral deposits. But to master the most volatile regions of these conditions can be obtained from the raw material has its own difficulties, if the forecast is no more the CSM of these factors.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Ohio State University researchers said, when the production environment of the Earth, solar-friendly, the rose could be a new &#8220;green.&#8221; Scientists have developed a new dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">battery</a> used by the color red and white, mixed metal oxide powder pink showing, you can catch the sun.<br />
Apparently, these new pink materials, is the best material for photoelectric conversion, despite the conversion efficiency has been implemented in commercial silicon solar cells by half, but its cost is only one fourth of solar cells silicon.<br />
Pink dye sensitized solar cells is the most typical color. Most dyes contain a ruthenium, ruthenium red. With the red dye mixed with rose powder most commonly used metal oxide is titanium oxide or zinc oxide, these two types of metal oxides are white. However, researchers at Ohio University created a more innovative materials does color, they used metal complex, exploring different particle shapes to improve performance of photoelectric conversion.<br />
This is the first time, researchers use non-unique dye manufacturing oxide sensitized solar cells. Choose stannate zinc because zinc stannate belongs to the complex oxides with tunable properties. This characteristic makes the next cut of dye sensitized solar cells possible.<br />
Why dye sensitized solar cells are pink rather than blue like silicon solar cells do? Traditional solar cells with a blue because the fight against the causes of reflective coating. These include improving the absorption of light green, light green spectrum is the most powerful solar light.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-xps-m140.htm">dell xps m140 battery</a>  Ohio University researchers developing complex materials and it is not anti-reflective coating.<br />
Color determines the solar cell can capture the wavelength of light, scientists can change the color of the special characteristics of solar cells optimized. Currently, the development of dye sensitized solar cells, scientists have used ruthenium red dye obtained the best results.<br />
If you want to get the best efficiency, we must consider access to voltage and current. The tension is a kind of material can provide the potential energy, now is the amount of material capable of transmitting the charge. If you can absorb a wide range of wavelengths, it would have to sacrifice power. If the absorption of energy limit is very high, can achieve high voltage, but had to sacrifice being. Researchers want to find a fair balance.<br />
Since the 20th century, 60 years since the silicon solar cells appeared. Since the 20th century, scientists began to develop the dye sensitized solar cells 90. In the dye sensitized solar cells, dye molecules cover the tiny particles of metal oxide have lived, and with the insertion of a thin film. Dye molecules capture light energy and release electrons,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-pp2182l.htm">hp pp2182l battery</a> while the metal oxide particles was more like a thread, will be among the electronic transmission to the circuit, but the transfer of electrons between the particles may be lost. These researchers are developing tiny nanowires to merge to be sent directly to the causes of electronic circuits.<br />
They are also exploring the possibility of using nano-trees &#8211; nano-son-shaped tree branches etc.. Which structure is to absorb light and improve the current structure? The researchers studied tree! Leaves provide a large surface for capturing light, the branches will be transferred to the roots of nutrition. In their design of dye sensitized solar cells, dye particles will cover the surface, the nano-trees do not grow between the leaves of these branches, electronic transmission.<br />
Therefore, the following dye sensitized solar cells grow a tiny tree &#8220;pink&#8221;, but other colors are also possible. Researchers are studying to work better in the new dyes and dye compounds.</p>
