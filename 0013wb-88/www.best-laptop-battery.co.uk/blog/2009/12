In order to make businesses more understanding of the lead acid battery technology battery recycling process, &#8220;Chemical Physics power supply system, an interview with Merloni engineering design-related trading company responsible person details about the used lead acid battery recycling technology processes, applications and perspectives.<br />
Market demand is the fundamental industrial development<br />
Q: Melloni in China over the past three decades, a growing development in the location, please tell us about development in China?<br />
A: The design of engineering and trading company Merloni Merloni Group, a subsidiary of Italian engineering. Founded in 1973, is engaged in export and transfer of technology and patents, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-338794-001.htm">338794-001</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-361742-001.htm">361742-001</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-371785-001.htm">371785-001</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-372772-001.htm">372772-001</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-398876-001.htm">398876-001</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-417066-001.htm">417066-001</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-346970-001.htm">346970-001</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-367759-001.htm">367759-001</a> the Italian professional society, customers around the world. Especially in the design, establishment of an industrial production line has a wealth of experience has now been established in 23 countries around the world more than 100 production lines and factories. Beijing and Shunde in China, Russia and Moscow Lippe Rizk has offices in Switzerland to build a branch. China has established 43 projects, six are joint ventures. Its scope of environmental protection, construction materials, industrial electrical and mechanical, electrical, automotive and electronics. It is from the mid-80s on the Chinese market, and to do is export of household appliances technology transfer of production from 2000, Italy has lead to the acid battery recycling appliances and processing technologies, the rapid development of China lead acid battery industry, In 2006, the internal promotion of new environment-friendly energy sources &#8211; cars, trucks have used the recycling of lead acid batteries and renewable raw materials, production, processing and recycling.<br />
Q: Melloni aggressively promote lead-acid battery recycling technology process, and the application of this technology in China, what happened?<br />
A: Lead-acid battery recycling technology transformation in China has broad prospects for development. With the automotive, telecommunications, electricity, rail transport and the rapid development of automobiles, motorcycles, electric vehicles, the use of railways, military use, fixed use, traction, storage of the energy and emergency power supply seamless lead-acid with the growing demand for battery, domestic annual consumption of lead from 35 to 40 million tonnes. A period of time after the use of lead acid batteries need to update, at present, produce various types of waste lead-acid batteries per year is around 5000 ~ 60 million euros weighing approximately 30 million tonnes. With the new demand growth in the farm, the number of discarded lead-acid batteries are expected to increase.<br />
Currently, in Europe, the United States, Japan and other developed countries, lead-acid battery using the recycling rate of 90% or more, while only 60% of our country, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3284u-1brs.htm">pa3284u-1brs</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3285u-1brs.htm">pa3285u-1brs</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3285u-2brs.htm">pa3285u-2brs</a> and a number Small companies are mainly engaged in lead-acid batteries, but there are a lot of lead, after its abandonment, if used correctly, will be enough on the environment in secondary pollution. China has now been done, but the technology is immature, the future of this technology there is a great improvement, space development. Recovery of post-processing technique back easily lead battery recycling low utilization rates. The State has adopted policies to encourage and support large-scale manufacturers of battery recycling used batteries, which is the development trend, and we have the technology, just follow the market demand to meet business needs.<br />
Conduct waste battery recycling and reuse acid lead to resource conservation, enhance environmental protection and implementation of sustainable development strategies, of great importance. The State shall promote environmental protection, both to support the protection of the environment, but also a shortage of galena to save resources for lead acid battery manufacturers with raw materials is conducive to economic development circular.<br />
Lead-acid recycling efforts cells enter the heights of<br />
Q: Currently, lead-acid battery recycling technology process, there are many, may I ask our technology to recover after the battery is to know how?<br />
A: The lead acid battery technologies, including battery crushing, washing, sorting, desulfurization, smelting, refining and bullion and other technologies, can be summarized as mechanical grinding, separation water, chemical desulphurization and melting furnace short. All processing plants to achieve low emissions, low pollution, low power, high efficiency in solving the pollution problem of used batteries at the same time, established a recycling, environmental protection and efficiency Battery model waste of industrialization.<br />
Lead-acid battery recycling technology for waste treatment,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-fru-92p1141.htm">fru 92p1141</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r32.htm">ibm thinkpad r32 battery</a>  is Merloni company with years of experience and outstanding technical R &amp; D capabilities and create. Compared to conventional treatment, which reflects many advantages: the batteries used in broken steps, installation of two broken hammer, preventing the unit from breaking and the maximum size of material, the process for next step separation has created a good basis for the grid plate can be cleaner and more deeply with other oxides and plastic components for separating, in the broken material sorting system, equipped with two sets of hydraulic separation device in May a greater degree of recovery of lead metal, the recovery levels of residues of lead in plastics could be reduced to 1.5%. At the same time, Polypropylene, would be fully and thoroughly cleaned, waste lead-acid batteries to separate the plaster in the melting pot before being required to perform specific chemical desulfurization processes, the use of sludge added the material of lead carbonate, so the mud Lead All sulfur can be converted to another use of renewable raw materials, thus reducing emissions of sulphides in the fusion process, recycling of water from the factory effluent wastewater has been to concentrate, non-polluting, emissions of NO.<br />
Q: What is our service model in progress?<br />
A: Because each resource area batteries are limited, so we only have an office in Beijing to provide services to clients across the country. We lead products of battery acid, transfer of technology and equipment. Domestic customers include windsurfing, camels and so on. In Europe and the United States and the Middle-developed countries and regions, North America, Europe, 95% recycling of waste batteries, most of whom are from the production of lead battery manufacturers of acid complete and the project has received strong government support. Believe that China will become more and more companies in the recycling of used lead-acid batteries in the past.<br />
With the development of new energy in the world<br />
Q: It is understood that we are implementing a turnkey project, specifically how the turn-key projects like?<br />
A: Melloni Design AG hopes that the transfer of technology, advanced technology, training of local staff, enabling its customers to participate in project development.<br />
Turnkey project, once completed, the plant or project ownership and project management to complete the construction and the investment side, by its begun to enter the formal production and operational phases.<br />
Turnkey construction is completed, there was still a large number of monitoring services. One is training to employment. Highly specialized equipment, use and maintenance have many requirements. Secondly, regular professional maintenance. Regular professional maintenance is only focused on certain key equipment, and the board should be on building contractors and other professional societies. 3 is a major change. Many chemical type of material life are 5 to 10 years while the useful life of equipment can usually 20 years or more. Therefore, the process will require the use of different materials based on the life and status of a replacement.<br />
The spirit of the technology to create a green life in entrepreneurship, with the help of advanced technology and equipment, strong technical force and scientific management mode, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1280.htm">apple a1280 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1281.htm">apple a1281 battery</a> became China&#8217;s handling used lead acid recycling company batteries a marvelous work, working to &#8220;protect the battery from the environment, man-made clothes,&#8221; the target for renewable energy in China and contribute to the development of environmental protection.</p>

<p>Even if the first 10 months of this year, production of motorcycles fell 12.9% to 20.4194 million, and invited further suggest that the activity of a motorbike is not easily to electric vehicles, &#8220;It &#8216; is not a mature product, mileage, battery life, and the performance and security at home and abroad are also involved in the conceptual stage to do technically. &#8221;</p>
<p>Drums, for example, household electric vehicles using lead-acid batteries, but there are foreign institutions of the analysis showed that the lead acid batteries for electric utilities, which also comes from coal, 80% global emissions of carbon dioxide lead acid batteries with equivalent conventional gasoline engine for the moment, there are still lead, the acid battery recycling is difficult, problems of pollution lead; overseas using a lithium hydride and nickel-metal batteries are mostly Li-ion battery production, but issues of consistency and security throughout the world until now has not been fully resolved,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">vgp bps8</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm">vgp bps8a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9.htm">vgp bps9</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9-s.htm">vgp bps9/s</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10.htm">vgp bps10</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10a.htm">vgp bps10a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10a-b.htm">vgp bps10a/b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10b.htm">vgp bps10b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">vgp bps11</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">vgp bpl11</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps13.htm">vgp bps13</a> in addition to lithium &#8211; the high cost of batteries.</p>
<p>Although Li Bin Motorcycle Company does not endorse the so-called &#8220;interest group&#8221;, but has approved new standards for interior unlikely to 20-50 km per hour, the electric car to open a path separate, and he even suggested the abolition of this there is a huge controversy level speed of the electric car production and sales, and urges the existing electric car companies to implement technical improvements (over 50 km / h production quart electric motorcycle sales), while 120 million pairs of fait accompli &#8220;victims&#8221; to give 23-year phase-out transition. The Association is also currently developing electric vehicles and new energy vehicle development.</p>
<p>Cycling Association: &#8220;It&#8217;s their idea of a unilateral&#8221;</p>
<p>Motorcycle industry is &#8220;clean&#8221;? Lu Jinlong said yesterday by telephone CBN reporter, that is their affair. &#8221;</p>
<p>Commission in developing the previous GB standards for electric vehicles, the National Automotive Standardization Technical Committee motorcycle Branch (hereinafter referred to as the National Standard Committee of motorcycle steam Branch &#8220;) has conducted extensive research. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-1brs.htm"> pa3399u-1brs</a></span></span>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-2brs.htm">pa3399u-2brs</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3400u-1brs.htm">pa3400u-1brs</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3420u-1brs.htm">pa3420u-1brs</a>Although the National Standard Committee of the steam in the steam Motorcycle Association chapters and branches are not a motorcycle organization, but all belong to associations motorcycle industry, as well as Lu Jinlong think it was &#8220;one&#8221;.</p>
<p>For the abolition of 20-50 km per hour production of electric vehicles and sales, the dragon land In an interview with CBN interview yesterday, said: &#8220;It&#8217;s their idea of a unilateral declaration.</p>
<p>Lu Jinlong main reason is that the quality of the electricity demand in the automotive market. He believes the biggest difference between China and foreign countries have different national conditions and foreign in order to add subway cars especially at home, electric car affordable is a necessity for human life, travel, the car is still a luxury.</p>
<p>In China, the electric car is still in the army of robust growth, the momentum and motorcycle counter the trend is more, the annual production has more than 20 million euros.</p>
<p>CBN interviews found that both companies car company or electric motorbike are confident that market demand for electric cars is not wrong, but they referred to regulatory mechanisms distinct from China. That is, electric cars by the quality and technical supervision of state management, implementing the licensing system is currently licensed companies have over 2000, while motorcycles and cars from the Ministry of Industry and information technology management,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r60.htm">ibm thinkpad r60 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-fru-92p1141.htm">fru 92p1141</a> implementation of the access market, not only the investment threshold, and sector management specialist, there&#8217;s R &amp; D, the conditions of production, process and test a complete set of strict criteria, is currently approved only to Sheung over 100 manufacturing firms.</p>
<p>In addition, the Road Traffic Safety Law, the relevant provisions is also a place for a breakthrough. 1999 &#8220;General Electric Bicycle technical conditions&#8221; provisions of electric cars, a maximum speed of not more than 20 kilometers, when there is only a &#8220;Road Traffic Management Regulations&#8221;, but the latter following the 2004 and 2008, two amendments to increase as &#8220;Traffic Safety Act, has in Article 58 provides that&#8221; persons with disabilities in a wheelchair with motor vehicles,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1061.htm">apple a1061 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1078.htm">apple a1078 battery</a>  electric bikes in the non-motor vehicles traveling in the province, maximum speed not exceeding 15 kilometers. &#8220;This means that the&#8221; Road Traffic Safety Law &#8220;is the higher law, all of the standard formulation of the right to be in positions of power in the context of development, unless the law itself than an amendment.</p>

Sharp is the main features of this phone is the first time in Japan back in the chassis is equipped with a solar battery module. In emergency situations such as cell margin is equal to zero, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d505.htm">dell latitude d505 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d510.htm">dell latitude d510 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d520.htm">dell latitude d520 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d600.htm">dell latitude d600 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d610.htm">dell latitude d610 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d620.htm">dell latitude d620 battery</a>it can be used as an auxiliary power source. &#8220;Prosecution sun for about 10 minutes when the call lasts about 1 minute in standby could insist on approximately 2 hours (KDDI).<br />
    SH002 is also a charger, it also equipped with a reception at single band, FeliCa e-billing capabilities, the GPS receiver and Bluetooth transceiver functions such as high-end mobile phones in Japan, all features function of &#8220;full&#8221; model. And also has a resistance level IPX5/IPX7 water. Produced with the assistance of technical personnel has been dismantling.</p>
<p>    Anti-noise solar battery module</p>
<p>    First, look at the screen with a parts of the solar battery module. Sharp is equipped with solar cell module development. Dimension of about 67.5mm x 41.0mm x 0.8mm. To achieve the thickness of 0.8mm, using the technology of semiconductor packaging. &#8220;Whether domestic large-scale solar battery module thin. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">vgp bps2</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm">vgp bps2a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2b.htm">vgp bps2b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2c.htm">vgp bps2c</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl2.htm">vgp bpl2</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">vgp bps8</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm">vgp bps8a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9.htm">vgp bps9</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9-s.htm">vgp bps9/s</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10.htm">vgp bps10</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10a.htm">vgp bps10a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10a-b.htm">vgp bps10a/b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10b.htm">vgp bps10b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">vgp bps11</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">vgp bpl11</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps13.htm">vgp bps13</a>Tectonics completely different&#8221; (technical staff, a Japanese manufacturer of solar cell).</p>
<p>    According to Sharp this conversion efficiency of solar cell modules is 13%, the maximum output power of 300mW Note 1). The output voltage of 4.5V, the voltage can be used for lithium-ion batteries. &#8220;10 The output voltage of 0.5 V solar cell polycrystalline silicon serial (the technical staff above). Module grounding has 9 dorsal electrode. Assisting in the dismantling of Japanese manufacturers of mobile phones and technical staff to speculate: &#8220;module of solar cells may play a role in the antenna can easily generate electromagnetic noise. Thus, to take an anti-noise measurements. &#8221;</p>
<p>    Shows part of the chassis is equipped with features of low power consumption of 1.1-inch monochrome e-paper. Solar battery module can display the feeding process with the performance when loading and free talk time. E-paper with a bright side to sensors, from the values obtained in the module&#8217;s electronic paper display in the use of solar cells in the process of charging efficiency.</p>
<p>    SH002 The main emphasis on two motherboards to PCB. RF circuits, digital circuits, signal processing, etc. Almost all major components encapsulated in the side of the motherboard. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r52.htm">ibm thinkpad r52 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-t40-series.htm">ibm thinkpad t40 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-t41.htm">ibm thinkpad t41 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-t43.htm">ibm thinkpad t43 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-t60.htm">ibm thinkpad t60 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r60.htm">ibm thinkpad r60 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-fru-92p1141.htm">ibm fru 92p1141 battery</a>Vice-package-board, single module single band tuner and FeliCa with sending and receiving circuit. Components on the motherboard, such as RF circuits, power circuits and circuits for digital signal processing and so uniform. &#8220;It is very common in models of high-end Japanese components configured&#8221; (The Japanese manufacturers of mobile phones and technical staff).</p>
<p>    The motherboard for mobile phone chips Qualcomm &#8220;MSM7500. It is the use of a high-pass and KDDI mobile phone to develop a common platform &#8216;KCP +&#8217; standard chips, but also integrated into the GPS transceiver circuit. Sharp models from the summer of 2008 &#8220;W62SH&#8221; has begun to support KCP + terminals. Telephone main circuit follows the design of the original models, but their main efforts on the packaging of solar cell modules.</p>
<p>    Various methods of sealing the upper and lower casing</p>
<p>    Equipped with solar cell modules, in addition, SH002 Another important feature is resistance to water IPX5/IPX7-level. The upper and lower waterproof case to achieve in different ways. Shows part of the chassis used is to use double sided tape on a frame with LCD panels and solar cell module sheet structure mask.</p>
<p>    The keyboard side of the chassis used in both chassis and battery cases, respectively, between the folder structure in the filling of waterproof rubber for resistance to water. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1245.htm">apple a1245 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1280.htm">apple a1280 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1281.htm">apple a1281 battery</a> The side of the keyboard chassis material is fiberglass reinforced nylon resin off. In both upper and lower case are two ways of seeing &#8220;is also waterproof handheld products to achieve a very common approach&#8221; (The Japanese manufacturers of mobile phones and technical staff).</p>
<p>    Improving the robustness of the measures is also equipped with rechargeable batteries can be seen. SH002 is equipped with lithium-ion rechargeable battery electrode is used in the shrink wrap on the motherboard to connect the terminal building. Japanese mobile phone rechargeable batteries typically radiate a flat electrode. The Sharp by changing the electrode structure so that when the phone slipped under circumstances such as poor contact of the battery has been defused.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-aspire-5520.htm">acer aspire 5520 battery</a> This electrode structure, Finnish Nokia and other handset manufacturers have adopted from abroad through the national mobile phone in Japan is also very rare &#8220;(technical staff above).</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Essential accessories products such as cell phone charger how to buy, many people still know little. Reporter visited the market, found that in the national unity before the cell phone charger,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery</a> look cheap and convenient &#8220;universal cell phone charger&#8221; has become the choice for many people. However, those behind the convenience, but also the number of security risks to hidden?</p>
<p>Complaint charging &#8220;universal&#8221; twice scrapped</p>
<p>Paving, Mr. Lin, who lives in a repair shop mobile phones has recently purchased a manufacturer unspecified &#8220;universal charger&#8221; for the first time during normal use, can be used on the second time is a problem , plug the power less than 10 minutes, we heard &#8220;bang&#8221; is heard, followed by white smoke appeared charger, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">vgp bps2</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm">vgp bps2a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2b.htm">vgp bps2b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2c.htm">vgp bps2c</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl2.htm">vgp bpl2</a>the battery also &#8220;fly&#8221; up and disposal not be used. The next day he found the cell phone shop for repair, the owner denied having sold the chargers. In desperation, he had complained to the corporate sector. The patience and conciliation by police officers, owners of mobile phone shop had finally recognized the cell phone charger is its sale, and agreed to offset the loss of Mr. Lin.</p>
<p>Reporter yesterday 12,315 from the city center has been informed that this year the city industrial and commercial department has received hundreds of complaints from mobile phone charger consultation, mainly concentrated in the charger can not be a normal load, fever, pricing of the explosion, three packages of non-compliance with obligations to suppliers, etc..</p>
<p>Investigation &#8220;Universal Charger&#8221; brand at less than 10 yuan, a number of</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter visited Taiwan Egami Street, Xianyu Road, lake pond near the mobile phone retailers found that &#8220;universal support&#8221; almost everywhere. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gd761.htm">gd761 battery</a> ,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">inspiron 6400 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d800.htm">latitude d800 battery</a>  This charger seems almost the same, there are nearly 10 kinds of brands, with an average price of only 7 yuan, the lowest in a store is willing to sell the yuan 5. The Universal Charger Multi-symbol-free 3C, construct or less the same texture mainly outer plastic plywood on the front, there are two metal contact, no matter what size, what shape, cell phone batteries simply use &#8220;universal support&#8221; from the battery grip of the brace, and let the metal clip on the metal contacts in close contact with the contacts on the battery, switch the power on the list.</p>
<p>During our visit, found in the province of Guangdong Industry and Commerce Bureau recently issued cell phone batteries, traffic, shippers of sampling, the four indicators unskilled &#8220;Scud&#8221; Travel Charger (Model SC537A 220 V ~ 50Hz ≤ 100mA) in the city some shops still sell communications equipment. It is reported that these projects fail, the user may be directly in the course of electric shock or burn when the battery charge.</p>
<p>Saying: &#8220;Universal Charge&#8221; just for emergency needs</p>
<p>From business presentations, &#8220;Universal Charger&#8221; The biggest feature is charging very fast, with one or two hours original charger need to charge the battery, it can be just about an hour.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f2024b.htm">hp f2024b battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/hp-f4486b.htm">hp f4486b battery</a>  However, this low cost to build a &#8220;simple universal charge&#8221; really reassuring for the use? &#8220;The quality and technical supervision departments of experts said in an interview, choose the universal charger, just for emergency needs.</p>
<p>According to experts, the original charger mobile phone is over-protective circuit voltage allows the output voltage is always maintained at 3.6 volts, and equipped with a transformer rectifier devices, allowing high pressure variable low-voltage direct current into alternating current. The majority of non-formal manufacturers universal charger, charger inside the coil without protection can easily cause a voltage or current is too high, even if they could be completed instantly recharge, but in fact the battery has not really full and running out of battery, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3478u-1brs.htm">toshiba pa3478u-1brs battery</a>because there is no protection circuit high voltage is also easy to recharge the battery of drums, and sometimes even an explosion hazard, cell phones can also be easily burned. It is proposed that consumers are better off using the official mark or original charger.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Advances in energy associated with the electric vehicle industry, lead acid batteries every technological innovation, will be the electric vehicle industry, a milestone in the history of development. And also the way lead-acid batteries lithium batteries, nickel-metal hydride batteries, gel batteries. In particular, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-gd761.htm">gd761 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-6400.htm">inspiron 6400 battery</a> gel batteries, manufacturers generally will be the &#8220;most standard laboratory data&#8221; as a commitment gel battery performance to the user good proof! For example: &#8220;Following a long line of mileage, three sacks for a period of 18 months to 24 months, cost-effective high&#8221; and so on. Because of its performance has been shown is &#8220;Tempting Heart&#8221; causing some customers to lose to try! This phenomenon was most obvious is that, in 2003.</p>
<p>In the actual process of using the time to make a fair decision, gel batteries came along 5 years, what is the situation?</p>
<p>First, the market share of nearly zero; Secondly, most users reaction gel batteries in the summer heat and severe swelling due to the battery &#8220;sudden death&#8221;, the third, gel batteries could cause an explosion, causing fires The four discharge performance is bad, you may need to carry heavy current can be. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">vgp bps2</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm">vgp bps2a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2b.htm">vgp bps2b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2c.htm">vgp bps2c</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl2.htm">vgp bpl2</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">vgp bps8</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8a.htm">vgp bps8a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9.htm">vgp bps9</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9-s.htm">vgp bps9/s</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10.htm">vgp bps10</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10a.htm">vgp bps10a</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10a-b.htm">vgp bps10a/b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10b.htm">vgp bps10b</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">vgp bps11</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">vgp bpl11</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps13.htm">vgp bps13</a></p>
<p>For gel batteries, these Mishap The reason, industry experts believe that the following six</p>
<p>1. In theory, the volume of gel batteries with greater capacity, longer life, high and low temperature better. However, as domestic production of gel batteries, either prescription or infusion gel plate, are not in accordance with standards of the industry, leading to low performance, short life and other issues.</p>
<p>2. Currently domestic battery gel battery electric bike does not gel with foreign countries, as made in China in the AGM separator, through the vacuum injection, the silicon cavity and acid solution sulfuric filling the battery between the positive and negative plates.</p>
<p>3. Gel batteries manufactured in China began as rich fluid, and other VRLA batteries differ. Batteries freezing during the initial period, can be the oxygen valve regulated lead acid battery recycling, because the freezing of positive and negative electrodes were surrounded. Is the positive plate above the oxygen generated can not be transmitted to the negative, can be reached with the Board of negative electrode active material to restore the lead. Only through the exhaust valve in the discharge. Compatible with flooded batteries. Therefore, premature exhaust particles are mixed with acid, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r51.htm">thinkpad r51 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-t40-series.htm">thinkpad t40 battery</a>  the particles easily adhere to the battery case, so that some users have reported leakage of battery acid.</p>
<p>4. Gel battery life over time, began to dry and shrink colloid, resulting in cracks, oxygen through the cracks of oxygen directly to the cycle of negative. Oxygen cycle while inhibiting water loss, oxygen cycle also produces great heat, so the battery from the elevated temperature, and even the formation of thermal runaway, which causes cracks increased, the formation of the internal life of the battery breaking a sudden end.</p>
<p>5 colloidal conductive resistance is much greater than the sulfuric acid content in the liquid, resulting in electric cars at the drop of battery voltage high current to start large motor starting torque decreased, the user can feel a bit helpless.</p>
<p>6, according ALABC (International Federation of lead acid batteries) data show that the average life expectancy is a rechargeable gel valve regulated sealed batteries 30%. This is the gel battery has good low temperature properties while they may not be the main reason for promoting the use of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>As the conductivity of polymer colloids is low, is generally not recommended as traction batteries, in particular, often heavy electric vehicles as means of transport, the proposed cost-effective electric vehicles use a lead the first high &#8211; battery acid, followed by a new generation of lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p>Gel batteries If, as the ad says, so good, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1280.htm">a1280 battery</a> why a large number of users of electric vehicles and select lead acid batteries do? Five years is proof that lead-acid battery is still the preferred mode of transport of energy!</p>

Global car battery lithium market will experience explosive growth, is one of many listed companies compete to attract a strong incentive. It is forecast that by 2014, cars with lithium batteries the size of the market grew to 24.8 billion U.S. dollars will be violent than the 2008 increase 214-fold. Faced with this festival, the investment opportunities to become a consensus: the car companies have extended the industrial chain in the battery business of producing batteries are reversed for vehicle manufacturers to carry out strategic cooperation and new enterprises also want to set foot in the lithium sumptuous feast of seek joint ventures to share points of the America&#8217;s Cup.</p>
<p>Constraints to eliminate gradually the ice</p>
<p>Reducing emissions and oil resources in response to the twin pressures of an increasingly scarce in most countries, the development of new energy vehicles will be deemed to revive its automotive and energy savings as Most important, while reducing the more stressful, and the United States for promoting the flagship development of new energy vehicles. Recently, the United States issued the &#8220;Joint Declaration&#8221;, said that both parties will be launched at the initiative of the U.S. electric car, the two countries in years to come, more 1 million electric cars in use. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">sony vgp-bps2 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm">sony vgp-bps2a battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2b.htm">sony vgp-bps2b battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2c.htm">sony vgp-bps2c battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl2.htm">sony vgp-bpl2 battery</a></p>

The U. S. Highway Administration optimistic forecasts, by 2015, the U.S. auto market, approximately 20% of the number of vehicles for hybrid cars, the market size of up to nearly 300 million euros. Currently, the U.S. market share of hybrids is only 3%. Its the same time, predicted that by 2020 the global automotive market will have half the cars sold in varying degrees of hybrid technology.</p>
<p>In China, published in March this year, &#8220;the restructuring of the automotive industry and the revitalization of planning&#8221; in the development of new energy vehicles have also developed a broad target &#8211; the next three years, China will form a plug 500,000 electric hybrid type and common hybrids Energy Qijuchanneng. In 2012, the new production vehicles, there will be 10% energy saving and new energy vehicles, vehicles with new energy should reach 500 billion &#8216;Euro Value Release yuan.</p>
<p>The face of such tempting cake, the car companies in North America have exposure to these products, with a view of the above. Compared to conventional vehicles, new energy vehicle technology gap with foreign countries do not, there is the possibility of exceeding bend, and have implications for automotive companies in North America to increase investment in new energy optimism vehicles.</p>
<p>Market such as Shanghai Automotive, according to business planning in 2010, a comprehensive fuel-efficient 20% of the Roewe 750 in the mixed hybrid cars will be mass: in 2011, Shanghai GM will launch with General S. U. Synchronized VOLT electric car in 2012, more fuel efficient than 50% of the Roewe 550 plug in cars will be available in volume solid mixture in the same year, the SAIC&#8217;s own brand of pure electric cars, you have to push the market really zero emission &#8220;.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the December 6 Changan Benben MINI success of pure electric vehicles, the assembly line, which is China&#8217;s first pure electric vehicles. Zhi-Xiang coupled to a low level of gasoline hybrid-electric cars, Zhi-Xiang gasoline-electric hybrid cars is moderate, Zhi-Xiang Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles Road Cheung Yuet, Changan Automobile energy new line of products Automotive increasingly improved. Under the plan, Changan Automobile will comply with the integration of a variety of approaches to new energy development technologies, the early days of hybrid gas vehicles, pure electric vehicles like the Focus, the progressive development of vehicles to fuel cell vehicles internal combustion engine to hydrogen.</p>
<p>In addition, Brilliance Auto, Geely Automobile, Dongfeng and other new energy vehicles have launched their new energy vehicle. Currently, however, are mostly government agencies and institutional clients to use, do not sell to individual consumers. As a national leader in new energy vehicles BYD, although already introduced three electric vehicles, including the end of the list F3DM originally intended for people in October this year, consumer sales, but because the conditions are not ripe, yet did not push the personal device market. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3285u-1bas.htm">toshiba pa3285u-1bas battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3285u-2bas.htm">toshiba pa3285u-2bas battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3356u-1bas.htm">toshiba pa3356u-1bas battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-1bas.htm">toshiba pa3399u-1bas battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-2bas.htm">toshiba pa3399u-2bas battery</a></p>
<p>Analysts point out that, in addition to electric cars themselves factors, the current constraints on their main external factors to promote the convenience charge and acquisition costs remain high, but these constraints are expected to break the ice.</p>
<p>Construction of a charging station is inseparable from the supporting grid. National Grid stakeholders to accept an interview with the newspaper China Securities admitted, the electric vehicle market pricing of immeasurable space, the company is ready to build. Over the past two years, there were 10 companies at the provincial level in research and experimental work, the company also conducted a number of cooperation with big car companies and research, did a lot of data is currently in full preparation for loading into the station building. Interestingly, the three major oil companies have also shown great enthusiasm and CNOOC are now main attack, such as electric cars and charging systems.</p>
<p>Other constraints &#8211; electric high purchase price of the vehicle, analysts stressed that to solve this problem, besides the need to reduce the cost of the car price itself, but also requires the government to reduce subsidies. Currently, most countries have subsidies for new energy vehicles, like the United Kingdom to buy PHEV and EV available to reward books 2000-5000, Japan&#8217;s electricity, natural gas and other clean energy vehicles to give 50% of the tax reduction. To encourage the development of new energy vehicles, the financial subsidy policies of China have also been introduced as fuel efficient hybrid vehicle in accordance with the standard rate of subsidy is divided into five files, the maximum grant per vehicle for 50 thousand yuan, pure electric vehicles, the subsidization of 60,000 yuan each. However, subsidy policies not yet implemented, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1079.htm">apple a1079 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1148.htm">apple a1148 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1175.htm">apple a1175 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1185.htm">apple a1185 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1245.htm">apple a1245 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1280.htm">apple a1280 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1281.htm">apple a1281 battery</a>car prices of energy vehicles will be used only for Purdah to marry. However, this may not make the car stand to wait too long, the country of new energy vehicles supervision of major projects, said Wang Binggang, head of the Consultative Group of Experts on the bus, etc. subsidy policy has been implemented, the subsidy policy is estimated that individual consumers will soon be introduced.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the market will grow</p>
<p>Analysts said that the convenience of subsidies and charging solution, the new energy vehicle market will grow explosively, and the scale of new energy vehicles for rapid expansion of traction batteries, motors, electrical control, etc. will of significantly increase the demand for this should become the next 10 years, the core driver of growth area. Among them, the performance of the battery power of developing new energy vehicles plays an important role. Endurance, consistency, security, and other indicators will determine the future of new energy vehicles, the pursuit of higher energy prices as high specific power, low self-discharge and long service life and security of a good motive power batteries, becomes an important issue of new energy vehicles.</p>
<p>The current hybrid cars use nickel-hydride technology battery metals major, but the nickel-metal hydride battery a number of technical features such as energy density, charge and discharge rate is close to its limits theoretical. The lithium battery has an energy density, high capacity, no memory, etc., are car manufacturers and battery suppliers unanimous support of the current national focus on R &amp; D is the lithium-ion batteries .</p>
<p>According to the different cathode materials, lithium batteries are cobalt oxide, lithium, lithium manganese oxide, ternary materials, and four types of lithium iron phosphate. Shen Wan said the report that compares the lithium cobalt oxide biggest problem is insecurity (150 degrees temperature of explosives), high cost and short life cycle, safety Lithium Manganese much better than the &#8216;lithium cobalt oxide, but the environment at high temperature cycle life is even worse (500 times). Lithium iron phosphate because of the power of discharge, low cost (about 18 ~ 30 Yuan / ton),<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">sony vgp-bps8 battery</a>，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9.htm">sony vgp-bps9 battery</a>，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10.htm">sony vgp-bps10 battery</a> ，<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">sony vgp-bps11 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">Sony VGP-BPL11 Battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps13.htm">sony vgp-bps13 battery</a> fast charging and long cycle life (over 1000) in the high temperature environment, stability from heat (temperature above 300 degrees only security risks) with good safety performance, and therefore the driving force is the best way to use cathode materials Li. Currently, prices of cars in China introduced models in purely electric vehicles, batteries power batteries are lithium, Chery, BYD uses iron phosphate lithium.</p>
<p>  <br />
  <br />
    Japan Professional Agency data from market research shows the energy market driving the battery shows explosive growth. Fuji Institute for Economic Research and Statistics, because of environmental friendly vehicles worldwide are sought, the hybrid and electric cars and sells the next few years, the automotive battery market is booming. Is expected in 2009 shipments of lithium batteries automotive sector will amount to ¥ 10,400,000,000 in 2008, double to 250 billion yen, but in 2014 the market size will expand rapidly to 2.25 trillion yen (about 24.8 billion dollars), is about 215 times in 2008.</p>
<p>Shen million, the report also stressed that the driving force of stack space for the future market of China is growing 10 times: in 2012 the new energy vehicles to 1 million, if the nickel &#8211; Hydrogen fuel cells represented 70%, Price 25,000 yuan / Taiwan, lithium batteries accounted for 30% of the, Unit 50 thousand yuan / Taiwan, in 2012, the nickel capacity-market hydrogen fuel cells will reach 17.5 billion &#8216;euro, the capacity of lithium batteries market is expected to reach 150 billion yuan, the global market will reach hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Listed companies are scrambling for gold</p>
<p>Faced with such a large cake in the motive power battery market, listed companies have invested in the share of the United States to saucers, while the car has a factory car business has become a major sponsor.</p>
<p>The battery has started to do to transform the car BYD Li-ion battery market in the power of natural resources demonstrate their abilities. In August this year, BYD electric vehicle production base in Huizhou batteries in Guangdong has completed its shoulder BYD electric vehicle technology base &#8211; the tasks of production of lithium batteries, it can be done in large scale production lithium batteries.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in order to achieve technological leadership, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-t43.htm">ibm thinkpad t43 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-t60.htm">ibm thinkpad t60 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r60.htm">ibm thinkpad r60 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-fru-92p1141.htm">ibm fru 92p1141 battery</a>a stable supply of power system battery in the passenger area of a new energy to accomplish something Futian car, also 10 at the end with the well known domestic manufacturer of lithium battery technology industry Peking University First configure the Beijing Automobile Investment Co., Ltd. invested in new energy Battery Technology Co., Ltd., Futian Automobile invested 10 million yuan or 10% of registered capital.</p>
<p>More remarkable is that, 12 17, Shanghai Automotive lithium iron phosphate and control technology based on the U.S. A123 Systems Inc. jointly announced that both parties will be established according to the proportion of shareholding 51: Shanghai Czech Republic 49, New Power Battery Systems Co., Ltd., co-development, production and sales system vehicle battery power to fill the position of market leader. The move also marks were &#8220;all thunder and no rain&#8221; in large-scale national models of new energy vehicles take strong measures.</p>
<p>In the vehicle plant, while an extension of the lithium battery, the companies producing lithium batteries are also cooperate actively with the car company. CITIC Guoan and Toyota of Japan on lithium carbonate and lithium salts series of downstream products, especially the application of new energy co operation signed a &#8220;letter of intent.&#8221; CITIC Guoan designated Japan as a single agent in Japan and the Japanese, at least annually a certain quantity of lithium carbonate. Since then, October 20, Fosugufen increase in lithium-ion battery market position and level of separation , decided to have a firm hand in BYD market demand and market outlook for the overall development of Foshan Jin Hui Hi-tech companies raise capital, expansion of lithium-ion battery Divide the project, to strengthen the overall competitiveness of the company.</p>
<p>In addition, lithium Jiangsu Cathay Pacific Airways, China Bao&#8217;an and a number of listed companies are also gold. Overall, Shanshangufen formed a relatively complete industrial chain, the company from a single Li-material ion battery anode began, one after another to build on the lithium battery cathode , electrolyte lithium-ion battery materials, such as a complete production line, became the country&#8217;s largest lithium-ion batteries supplier.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>Jackson, Marv eastern Uganda one of ordinary employees. He watched his son play with a plastic bag attached to the side in a football simple, while in the lament,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a> ,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-9300.htm">dell inspiron 9300 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-9400.htm">dell inspiron 9400 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-b120.htm">dell inspiron b120 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-b130.htm">dell inspiron b130 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-e1405.htm">dell inspiron e1405 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-e1505.htm">dell inspiron e1505 battery</a> a solar cell phone for his Lanhuo greatly improved the amount and probability of success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always been to find the name of a living person. Sometimes people call me directly, but the most unfortunate happening at a critical time of the mobile phone without electricity, because the problem that I missed several times. Therefore, when Uganda Telecom has introduced solar cell phone, I immediately bought one. Well now, I never missed no electricity due to close jobs. &#8220;Marv said.</p>
<p>Load bottleneck</p>
<p>Perhaps the mobile phone powered by solar cells that innovative does not seem to be beyond what the creative imagination, but for the regions of Asia and Africa have no access to supplies electricity or electricity rates are very expensive area of the large number of potential users is concerned, this product has a revolutionary significance.</p>
<p>This almost around the clock in the mobile phone equipment, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">sony vgp-bps2 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm">sony vgp-bps2a battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2b.htm">sony vgp-bps2b battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2c.htm">sony vgp-bps2c battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl2.htm">sony vgp-bpl2 battery</a> farmers could go see the prices of all crops, and then decided to sow. They can remain in their own fields below and buyers haggling, you can get weather information in a timely manner. More importantly, they basically have to worry about this cell phone use in nature, no electricity.</p>
<p>Indeed, before the advent of mobile solar and other mobile products have been standardized in the Indian subcontinent and Africa, most of the area applied. However, in the promotion process is a major problem is that the penetration of mobile phone products in these sectors was due to problems such as electricity supply was blocked. In developing countries, rural areas and do not have a convenient way to charge mobile phones.</p>
<p>According to data from the Organization for development, there are still 1.6 billion people worldwide live in areas not yet have access to electricity, but also a billion people who, though already having access to electricity but because the cost is too high and other factors simply can not meet daily needs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is more than 20 million people in the vast majority of people living in sunny regions, such weather conditions, solar mobile phone is an entry point.</p>
<p>In Uganda, for example, the national population of 32 million, only 8% have access to the grid.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3383u-1brs.htm">toshiba pa3383u-1brs battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3384u-1brs.htm">toshiba pa3384u-1brs battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3399u-1brs.htm">toshiba pa3399u-1brs battery</a> Even in some areas, such as Marv Mulago sphere such as the poor suburbs, the tariffs of electricity are very expensive and their service is intermittent, is not stable. &#8220;In our electricity in this region is very expensive, where each day around 6:00 in the morning, we put the doors closed, only open until 18h.&#8221; Marv said.</p>
<p>Before the introduction of mobile solar Marv and other local residents to give them charge their cell phones should go to city suburbs, where they will be in the noise of a generator running when the accusation. And such a trip might have to spend the whole day, pricing, costs are equal to the salary of their day.</p>
<p>The next billion users</p>
<p>The world has 3.0 billion mobile phone users. Many analysts agree that the next billion users seem to be of most emerging markets, particularly in rural areas of these markets. &#8220;This trend is clearly behind the existence of a large number of business opportunities, especially in areas where access to electricity is very limited.&#8221; Research institutions Juniper in the telecommunications industry, chief analyst said.</p>
<p>At present, solar energy market of mobile telephony has been that there has been a great movement manufacturers Nokia, Samsung and ZTE, among others. Although the emphasis on solar energy used in western countries to reduce carbon emissions, there is not a small market, but these companies still believe that a larger market, but also turning emerging markets in poor areas.</p>
<p>In the state of Orissa in India in remote areas, farmers have actually started using solar energy.<br />
Bangladesh, too. The inhabitants of these areas is concerned, there is no obstacle to accept mobile phone solar.</p>
<p>VNL RajivMehrotra is chairman, the expertise of the Indian company is producing solar base stations for mobile networks. &#8220;If you&#8217;re the Indian perspective on the current map is relatively low density areas of mobile phones, then we will see that these places are around the sun.&#8221; He said. Who would have been produced by the target company is to base stations to 20 million mobile phone services to potential users, the latest base station only 2 to 4 solar panels to power, and can be installed on all roofs.</p>
<p>In India in areas with no electricity supply, the base stations of telecommunication, mainly by diesel generators to provide energy. According to statistics, in the telecommunication stations in India as a base in remote areas consumed 2.0 billion liters of diesel per year. In the future, India will build a base station of 100,000 additional annual.<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">sony vgp-bps8 battery</a> ,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps9.htm">sony vgp-bps9 battery</a> ,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps10.htm">sony vgp-bps10 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps11.htm">sony vgp-bps11 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl11.htm">Sony VGP-BPL11 Battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps13.htm">sony vgp-bps13 battery</a>  United States ABI research report also noted that Brazil, Russia, India and China and other BRIC countries in 2010, construction of base stations will reach 230.000, most of them concentrated in suburban areas or more remote areas.</p>
<p>For handset manufacturers and operators involved, the potential market in rural India may be staggering. Is this calculation: India currently has about 500 million wireless end users, has also signed up 10 million users per month pace. This market has attracted manufacturers such as Samsung come. In June this year, the company has released a mobile phone solar SolarGuru India.</p>
<p>JhasketanPradhan a farmer in India, said through his mobile phone with a doctor for medical advice, for example, but also grain and agriculture officials in respect of any matter, you can also get weather forecasts .</p>
<p>In fact, there as early as 10 years, Nokia has launched a cell phone can take advantage of solar energy. Only a few years, as technology develops, this type of phone scale commercial mobile becomes possible.</p>
<p>Based on information currently available, such as mobile phone solar &#8220;sun&#8221;, an hour, about 5-10 minutes can provide talk time. SolarGuru phones such as Samsung, costing about $ 60 U.S., radio, MP3 ringtones, games and other functions.</p>
<p>Taking into account the market share of Nokia in India and Africa had reached 60% to 70%, a lot of people think that Samsung, ZTE mobile phones business initiatives such as solar energy in new manifestly not Nokia.</p>
<p>Two types of applications</p>
<p>If you have a configuration and a low-cost, solar power for cell phones to succeed in acquiring the 20 million users of a lack of regional support, may not be difficult. In addition, this product is probably in the &#8220;green&#8221; and &#8220;market return&#8221; two aspects of fame and fortune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, farmers in Bangladesh have begun to access the mobile phone to relevant commercial information. Prior to the intermediary can no longer be using the advantage of information asymmetry. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r60.htm">ibm thinkpad r60 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-fru-92p1141.htm">ibm fru 92p1141 battery</a>This change has also set up in Uganda and India. &#8220;Bangladesh, a university economics professor AbdulBayes said.</p>
<p>Bayes studies the mobile phone industry for the impact on economic development. In his view, the number of mobile phone users for every increase of 10%, then GDP will increase by 1% to 2%. He said that compared with cities in the past, farmers need to communicate with buyers and suppliers of agriculture, farmers can now access via mobile phones more complete information market.</p>
<p>In addition, solar energy heats the reason why mobile phones, another major requirements of the environmental aspect. According to Juniper forecasts of research institutes that by 2014, the green cell phone could achieve annual sales of 105 million units.</p>
<p>Industry mobile is the highest body of the planet is now the largest consumer electronics.</p>
<p>Now that the industry is to ask users who have greener, more environmentally friendly products. In this industry a huge turnover each year hundreds of billions of mobile phones sold, in which each product is packing boxes, accessories and tons of raw materials, including a number of rare elements.</p>
<p>Of course, the current situation, the solar energy industry of mobile telephony, there are many areas requiring improvement. But as some people suspect that the use of solar energy to reduce carbon emissions on the phone at the end, to have much effect. Ask a professional who said that, in fact, the electricity consumed by mobile phones is relatively small, the loading process has also become more efficient.</p>
<p>According to statistics, a cell phone user per year emissions of carbon dioxide by up to 25 kilograms. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/acer-aspire-5520.htm">acer aspire 5520 battery</a> At the end of 2008, global emissions of carbon dioxide by 93 megatonnes. In other words, through the mobile phone powered carbon emissions is only a small part.</p>
<p>Currently, Sony Ericsson and Nokia, two companies are developing some greener products, these products feature lies in the fact, consume less energy, materials, recyclable packaging and user&#8217;s guide more rational and well on. Meanwhile, Samsung and ZTE are also vigorously develop the solar power cell phones. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1185.htm">apple a1185 battery</a> The Sharp was on the Japanese market this year published its related products.</p>
<p>Kenyan mobile operator Safaricom has already sold the first batch manufactured by ZTE cell phone solar. &#8220;This August has just released new mobile phones will sell better than others. Safaricom vendor said.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>At a time when we buy a mobile phone is always concerned about the use of mobile phones and maintenance, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-8600.htm">dell inspiron 8600 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-inspiron-9200.htm">dell inspiron 9200 battery</a> while neglecting the maintenance of its parts, in effect, is also a need for maintenance parts, especially accessories origin. A battery life of origin for more than two years, if the misuse May cause shortened life expectancy to six months or less, but buy original battery will need more than 100 rooms, very profitable! Here are some basic cell phone batteries, their proper use.<br />
  <br />
    &#8211; Battery charger for mobile phone the best time to use the original or may affect the performance of batteries, lithium batteries can not EP (Expert Pormance) charger to use.</p>
<p>    &#8211; Battery Lithium load is normally shorter in the 1.5 to 4.5 hours between when the charger is better not to invest more than 224 hours. A new battery in the first 4 to 5 charge time by charging time should be preferably 14 to 15 hours but not more than 24 hours, each fully discharge and then recharge as much as possible,  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">sony vgp-bps2 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm">sony vgp-bps2a battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2b.htm">sony vgp-bps2b battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2c.htm">sony vgp-bps2c battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl2.htm">sony vgp-bpl2 battery</a> after such a cell after each use to get the best memories.</p>
<p>    &#8211; Charging and discharging of the ambient temperature should be close to room temperature (20 degrees), temperature will affect the battery charge and discharge capacity and talk time. Such as: battery exposed to extreme heat (40 degrees) when the battery capacity will be reduced by 40%, speaking time will be reduced by about 10%, the cell exposed to extremely cold places, the battery capacity will be reduced by 5%, call time is reduced to about 90%. Once the battery to restore and recharge at room temperature, but also back to normal.</p>
<p>    &#8211; Battery life depends on the number of repeated translation of power, he should try to avoid the battery still have some residual capacity along the way when the load is equivalent to shortening the life of the battery. Discharge may be mobile always-on, if the flow speed, may be the screen or the phone keypad, lighting open until the battery runs up to the automatic shutdown, it is preferable not to scavenger .</p>
<p>    &#8211; Improving the efficiency of the battery, first, require frequent cleaning of the contact points of the battery can be used Eraser point of contact should not be metallic conductors on the battery if the battery short &#8211; circuit may cause harm. Plus the one hand, in a sacrifice of their lives alone should use a quieter approach, short of ringtones.  <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1280.htm">apple a1280 battery</a> , <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1281.htm">apple a1281 battery</a> To use the savings mode is the most mobile phones available in &#8220;non-DTX-power streaming saving mode so that the Director of talk time can be 30-50%.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>There are such companies manufacturing equipment for lithium batteries from the earliest days of the three have progressively developed for the 400 people present, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery rechargeable</a> from a fixed mold independent research and begin development up to the entire Li-ion farm equipment manufacturing plants, from a humble plant a set of R &amp; D, design, manufacture, sale modern high-precision technology giant machinery manufacturing of lithium in the world -Powered device. This is the city of Dongguan Hosson Lithium Technology Co., Ltd. course of development, given the robustness of the cooperative market-exist with the boisterous to achieve a perfect and beautiful display of dazzling leap. This reporter recently on Hosson Dongguan City Lithium Technology Co., Ltd. Yu Shi, President of China had an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>Reporter: Hosson After a decade of rapid development, has become the largest investment in battery technology lithium, the highest level of equipment, one of professional manufacturers, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d620.htm">dell latitude d620 battery</a> and between avant-garde world of Li &#8211; ion battery industry equipment. We would like to know Hosson recently?<br />
Yu Shi-Min: Currently, our work can be summarized in four aspects.<br />
Firstly, the pioneers with domestic demand and international customers, increased R &amp; D team is currently building in the 3C with the mobile communications industry in the industrialization of large companies (such as : Guangdong, new energy, the strength of God, Guangyu) for Integrated Automation Equipment Development, vigorously to reduce the gap with foreign equipment, and be pioneers achieve energy industry lithium to the integration of automated assembly management.<br />
Second, the concerted participation of relying on low-carbon economy, energy strategy, the future society of investment in lithium-powered device for EV development work actively participate in lithium-TVU trade cooperation in lithium &#8211; powered batteries, such as BAK, CITIC Mengguli, universal cooperation is very good operation, and gradually formed a set design of the different structure of industrial equipment, to meet future demand for the lithium battery technology.<br />
Third, proponents of &#8220;Wal-Mart, the superstore concept, based on industry of the lithium battery of equipment to provide customers with integrated&#8221; Wal-Mart supermarket type of one-stop services,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">sony vgp-bps2 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2a.htm">sony vgp-bps2a battery</a>,  build trademark. Highlight the main ideas of his first customer, providing customers a comprehensive service of high quality.<br />
Fourth, the current focus of the company on promoting foster &#8220;turn-key projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reporter: The company is the market position of products is &#8220;to complete installation of all high-quality products for manufacturers of lithium batteries to provide direct support services, and similar products, cons forces Hosson and unique Where?<br />
Yu Shi-Min: first, the company&#8217;s operating philosophy and product positioning. 5 Equipment Matching Pursuit (CRAFT / functional / capacity / Environmental Design /), in principle, to promote easy and convenient. Made to adapt to market prices-effectiveness of new products. Secondly, the company has attracted many in the technology of lithium batteries has an experienced staff to join the real understanding, rapid and precise customer needs, significantly reducing development time, but also to modernize the equipment and the match between actual production. Will increase the company&#8217;s future in this regard the introduction of its efforts to attract more people to join the existing equipment of the company as an integrated way so that all the previous sub-semi-automated equipment in a relatively high degree of automation, automatic built to satisfy the market fast, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps8.htm">sony vgp-bps8 battery</a>  high quality, development of high quality Swiss products.</p>
<p>Reporter: propaganda tool is very diverse, with TV media, newspapers, Internet media, as far as I know, you&#8217;re very attached to the propaganda media, were also focusing on branding, is an entrepreneur with a keen vision and forward-looking performance is what prompted you to choose from Zhenwei group once again organized by the Shanghai expo as a platform to promote for the battery?<br />
Yu Shi-Min: market power lithium has now entered the era of competition from the Warring States period, processing previous small-scale mark on the stage of creation, the establishment of platform for essential communication. Each company to bigger and stronger, they are branding and advertising. Zhenwei company exposure in the energy sector has a wealth of experience, is the exhibition industry, an aircraft carrier, then I think the strength Zhenwei powerful and elite team, I think that the future will surely become a leading exhibition organized by the show business of the battery. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-fru-92p1141.htm">ibm fru 92p1141 battery</a> We are very optimistic about the team of talent and background Zhenwei ability to Zhenwei our main object of exposure.</p>
<p>Journalist: What will the images show appearance Hosson, showing that new technologies and products?<br />
Yu Shi-Min: The exhibition will combine the hot spots of the industry in the 3C Lithium-Powered device to provide the latest automation equipment, such as automatic packing lines, automatic injection lines fluid and newly developed cell device will be unveiled at the Shanghai exhibition. The company has achieved a unified image of advertising, the overall image of the company to build a platform with Shanghai submit a new corporate image.</p>
<p>Reporter: The development of new energy has been a hot topic. However, the current industry of new energy has just begun. Recently the State Council decided in 2020, emissions of carbon dioxide from China per unit of GDP compared to 2005 decreased by 40% to 45%, to achieve this goal, we must vigorously d &#8216; saving energy to reduce emissions, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1245.htm">apple a1245 battery</a> development of new energy in this regard Hosson have specific measures?<br />
Yu Shi-min: The decision of the Council of State is a good signal, especially for our industry is also a good signal. Strategic Distribution Company, the first increase in the intensity of processing automation equipment, pre-shift semi automatic to fully automatic. Secondly, the National Council after sales service and establish Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong and branches of other services, build a platform for international expansion plans in class Kong next year in Hong outside of a window. Thirdly, the provision of integrated industrial equipment, lithium batteries &#8220;turnkey&#8221; in terms of implementation, further efforts to meet the investor to quickly lithium-ion batteries to start the project in its whole and to assist them (investors) to provide the environment from the device to the optimization process, we will propose a program of investment and new concepts, especially the batteries driving force. create a better investment environment, rapid upgrade cycle battery manufacturing and promoting the development of the entire industry.</p>
<p>Reporter: In 2009, about to pass. For the next year 2010, plans Hosson&#8217;s?<br />
Yu Shi-Min: 2010 is the driving force behind the rapid development of China&#8217;s energy per year, but also a milestone in the company for one year. In 2009, we must make all preparations, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/apple-a1281.htm">apple a1281 battery</a> such as relocating factories of the company, and create a new environment, to attract high-end personnel stationed and enhance the new platform manufacturing company. Hosson company based industrial equipment, and promote the industrialization of China in the development of lithium. Details of the implementation of specific objectives have been started, and strive to become Navigator brand in the industry.</p>

                    <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Electric cars home do not, and the body can be sold as scrap metal, batteries, how?&#8221; Recently, this newspaper has received several enthusiastic readers call us. Journalist found that cars are electricity city many, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/">laptop battery</a> but the management of lead waste, recycling acid batteries has been a &#8220;blind spot&#8221;.<br />
&#8220;Trade-in&#8221; is a regulatory line</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the journalists took place five fork in the road where the two sides of the road is dotted with over 10 dealers electric cars. 1 owner of a store brand told reporters that the use of battery electric vehicles are mainly lead-acid batteries, lead acid batteries are consumables, branded batteries generally use 1 to 2 years for replaced. <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d610.htm">dell latitude d610 battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/dell-latitude-d620.htm">dell latitude d620 battery</a>The skipper of the introduction, approach the user is not more than two kinds: first, lead acid batteries will be discarded as waste or sold, the second is to have a number of dealers electric cars out there, &#8220;Trade-in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Journalists at the ground electric vehicle batteries must be replaced, respectively, a few electric cars to the dealership and repair tips, each store have expressed their trade in battery can be scrapped and that &#8220;the power of different types batteries are not the same price, usually ranging from 30 yuan to 100 yuan. &#8221;</p>
<p>Where to take batteries</p>
<p>Trade-in, the batteries are used where? The companies are exactly the same words: &#8220;We&#8217;re back builders and manufacturers to focus on the smelter lead. Old Depot batteries, the battery inside the lead will be extracted from the production of new batteries. &#8220;As for the rest of the acid how to deal with them are not sure. Some make the maintenance of batteries used in waste in general in terms of income people to acquire, from time to time, usually from 6 yuan per kilo. &#8221;</p>
<p>Departments of Environmental Protection: recycling of batteries remains to be standardized</p>
<p>Reporter contacted the Environmental Protection Agency, Solid Waste Management Center chief Chang said: &#8220;The State of the recycling of used batteries are required, must be a qualified business, but the city does not have such qualified for recycling. &#8220;According to Chef Chang describes, in addition, there are piles of flow of the rescue station. These acquisitions have all too often drained battery acid inside, then remove the battery inside the lead metal in the sale, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bpl2.htm">sony vgp-bpl2 battery</a>, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/sony-vgp-bps2.htm">sony vgp-bps2 battery</a>has been emptied of acid inside containing zinc, manganese, cadmium and other heavy metals, which contain harmful heavy metals in the acid directly to sewer, then infiltrated into the groundwater table, the consequences are frightening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facing the market town, the current state of recycling of used batteries should be resolved next year.&#8221; Chef Chang told reporters that good news about next year, the city will build a relatively comprehensive program of recycling, the recycling of used batteries use planning sanitation.<br />
It is understood that 70% of electric vehicle batteries are lead acid batteries, 30% nickel-cadmium batteries, life in general very short, but a battery electric vehicles are the damage caused by several times larger than ordinary batteries. The majority of electric vehicles currently on the market use of lead acid batteries contain acid that has a high solubility, which contains large quantities of lead acid inside, passing emissions will pollute the earth and produce lead fumes, <a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3285u-3brs.htm">toshiba pa3285u-3brs battery</a>,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/toshiba-pa3356u-1brs.htm">toshiba pa3356u-1brs battery</a> while the lead content of the body exceeded once on will lead to mental decline, easily induced malignant tumors of the child, and lead can not be easily disposed of &#8216;body.</p>
<p>As the treatment of battery recycling industry protecting the environment, many countries, the government should provide subsidies. For example, Switzerland and Japan, each dealing with a ton of waste batteries,<a href="http://www.best-laptop-battery.co.uk/ibm-thinkpad-r32.htm">ibm thinkpad r32 battery</a> a government grant business waste battery, about RMB 5000. In the United States, if the user is not used to return the battery manufacturers, retailers or wholesalers, each bought a new battery will need to pay U.S. $ 3-5, so the recovery of batteries States United almost 100%.</p>
