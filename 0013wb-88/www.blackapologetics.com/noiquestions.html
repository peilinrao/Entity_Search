<b>Questions For the Nation of Islam</b><br>
<ol>
<li> Shouldn’t there exist on the part of the Nation of Islam an acknowledgement that there were and still are Christians, black and white, who have vehemently spoken out against slavery and the violence done in the name of Jesus?<sup>[1]</sup></li>
<p>
<li>How do you reconcile the existence of white abolitionists who were outspoken against slavery and helped slaves escape to freedom with the Yacub theory that advances an inherent evil nature on the part of Caucasians?</li>
<p>
<li> If the bible has been tampered with, revised and rewritten, why does the Nation of Islam quote it so much?<sup>[2]</sup></li>
<p>
<li>On what objective evidence should we accept the meaning of 
key terms, as defined by Elijah Muhammed?</li>
<p>
<li>Why is the bible and Christian doctrine misrepresented so severely?</li>
<p>
<li> In the instances where scripture passages from the bible are used to make a point or refute some theological point, on what basis are these seen as authentic?</li>
<p>
<li>If white people were created by Yakub (a black scientist-god who accomplished this feat 6,600 years ago), how can whites be blamed for their status as "devils?" Isn't the black man, according to this scenario the author of the very evil that is being lamented?</li>
<p>
<li>Additionally, wouldn’t this Yacub experiment negate the good nature of black people that the NOI advances?</li>
<p>
<li> How is the forceful domination of Africa by Muslims explained? Additionally, what about the Christian origins in Africa prior to this domination? </li><br>
</ol>
