				<h3><a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/2010/04/2010-spring-tour-update-from-the-road/">2010 Spring Tour Update from the Road</a></h3>
								<p>Great Scott!!!!</p>
<p>You know we have been busy when it&#8217;s been a month since i wrote anything here. Lot&#8217;s has happened since march. The &#8216;Timestretch EP&#8217; has made the rounds, getting insane response at the shows, with &#8220;Bass Head&#8221; getting licensed to a new Ministry of Sound compilation before it was released on vinyl. BANG!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve not had a listen &#8211; the full EP can now be streamed <a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/listen/releases/timestretch/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>The Tour has thus far been one freak-show after another, many times in rapid succession, with oversold theatres spilling out into the streets on a Monday night, to  big weekend showdowns like the Fillmore in Detroit with Vadim &amp; Major Lazer, and crushing festival sets like Ultra and Coachella.</p>
<p>I have to give mountains of heartfelt thanks to my crew, because this has really been a full on sprint. Elliott has been holding everything together like a juggler at a Circus; with Lia overseeing everything from creative online multimedia to making sure all the fans are loved and sorted out; Trevor controls the insane rig of PK sound we have out with us; and Michael constantly experiementing with new lighting configurations as we prepare for the interactive light/video tests in the fall. Our beloved Daysha has taken a hiatus to focus on developing new projects, so we brought Jason in to handle Online Ops, and of course the Transpo Crew (Doug &amp; Andy) and the Sustainable Living Roadshow.</p>
<p>And of course, the constantly increasing enthusiasm from fans, supporters, loyal bass heads, and new converts as well. I love how positive and loving the crowds are both to us and to each other, even in the face of some of the illest, dirtiest, most cunning and crushing bass music to ever blast out of the speakers.</p>
<p>Ultra Music Festival was a great kickoff for the tour, getting to hang out with some of my favorite producers from around the world, and enjoy some Miami Bass before setting off for the culture shock of Nebraska: which was sold out mayhem on a Wednesday Night, and that was the official start of the run. From there it was slamming show after slamming show, with straight APE SHIT crowds in every place. Our first play in Minneapolis, bouncing a human banana in Milwuakee, and absolutely DEMOLISHING the Pageant in STL. Here is a dope video recap of that first week, courtesy of our Jack-of-all-trades, Ms Lia:</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/DjMbQOcXPmQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/DjMbQOcXPmQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>Monday night in Urbana was frightening, at 10pm Vadim had already whipped them into a frenzy, the room was THICK with steam, and Elliott was already nervous because the crowd was so rowdy. At this point Mondays are like Fridays!. Then on to Cleveland for 3 nights with the daggering phenomenon that is Major Lazer. What a fuckin bunch of TOTAL nutters! We capped off that run with a Sunday in Pittsburg, there were loads of kids outside with their parents before the show started and i got busted for trying to sneak them all in (ooops!) hahaaa.</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/jtf_nmhf_J0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jtf_nmhf_J0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>Coachella = HOLY FUGGIN SHEEEYOTT!!!! I was so nervous before going on, due to computer crashes, but when i stepped on that stage, the roar of one of that massive crowd hypnotized me. One of the highlights was getting to test run my new remix of Metallica&#8217;s &#8220;Seek &amp; Destroy&#8221; check this crowd out:</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/fWUKRbt_2WE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fWUKRbt_2WE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>Again, the culture shock of mega festival to smaller town was intense. But there were were, Monday night in Syracuse, and it was totally off the hook. That was the 1st of 7 nights in a row where we cruised through some of the most high energy groups of bass heads i&#8217;ve ever felt, heard, or hugged. With every night being a sold-out crowd it was awesome to test run some of this new music, as we are recording every set for an upcoming &#8220;live album&#8221; type thing…. these crowds are hella LOUD.</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/wqwA5Rswc5c&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/wqwA5Rswc5c&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>Now we got <a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/tour-schedule/">4 more inna row to go,</a> ending in New Orleans for Jazz Fest. Then a hometown play in <a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/2010/03/5-15-10-bassnectar-at-the-mezzanine-in-san-francisco/">San Fran on May 15</a> before the insanity of summer festival season kicks off at Summer Camp. <a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/tour-schedule/">Check the schedule here</a> for all our festival plays through June, July and August. We will be recording every set, so come add your voice to the roar of the crowd.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have a proper &#8216;program&#8217; for the upcoming fests soon, and keep your ears open for a new bootleg that is about to drop, as well as some exciting new editions to this website, STAY TUNED!!!!</p>
<p>As always we love your comments here, it has become pretty much the only place i have time to respond to, so if you are on Facebook or Myspace or whatever, make sure to swing by the site every once and a while and say whats up<br />

								<p><a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/release/timestretch/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3980 alignleft" title="Timestretch" src="http://www.bassnectar.net/wp-content/uploads/bassnectar-timestretch-cover-300x300.jpg" alt="Timestretch" width="250" height="250" /></a>Spring is here, and as we set sail for 5 wild weeks of tour, Amorphous Music teeming with excitement to announce the official release of the new Bassnectar EP: &#8220;Timestretch&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://timestretch.bassnectar.net" target="_blank">AVAILABLE NOW at our little record shop</a>. Each tune is only 99 cents, and there are cool bundles featuring new tricked-out merch, various musical formats (CD, vinyl, hi-fi) as well as bonus remixes and instrumental versions and loops.</p>
<p>The tour is laid out like dominoes and the entire Bassnectar Crew is super-charged with delight to erupt night after night after night after night with you in wild explosions of freakish abandon. Are you Ready?!?!?!?</p>
<p>Last January was supposed to be a vacation for me, but being the work-obsessed person that i am, i ended up working nonstop in the studio. And by February, i had created a lot of new material. Most of it was inspired by the hype of last year&#8217;s tour and is full of energy…perfect meltdown music for dancefloors. Plus the title track &#8220;Timestretch&#8221; came out so deep and beautiful to my ears, i decided &#8216;WHY NOT RELEASE THIS RIGHT AWAY!!!!&#8217;</p>
<p>Everyone thought i was crazy and delusional, cuz we were barely off the Cozza Frenzy whirlwind…hadn&#8217;t even finished the Northwest part of the tour, and i was supposed to be off in the Bahamas somewhere. Instead i was in a Bermuda Triangle (wake, work, sleep) and after putting the RUSH ON, i ended up with a STACK of new material… most of it is pretty pulverizing, in that i wasn&#8217;t trying to craft beautiful music, but was working with really fun jams of intense, freak-out bass music…tunes i can use on the Spring Tour and such.</p>
<p>I decided to call it Timestretch because it correlates with one of my favorite philosophies; How to slow down time and enjoy it on an ever-deepening level. With each day in my life that passes i develop an increasing gratitude for the blessings i have, and am constantly learning to see challenges as exciting possibilities for growth and healthy change.</p>
<p>So it was this kind of deep love for life that i genuinely wanted to pass on in the form of music. A small reminder to focus each day on what you have in your life that you are grateful for.<br />

								<p>BADAYAOOOO… Over a month since the last update from Labs. I&#8217;ve been wrapping up the new EP, and recovering from our roadshow antics in February. Check out the <strong><a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/see/photos/2010-winter-run/" target="_self">photo section</a></strong> for a look back on the Winter run so far.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/wp-content/uploads/2-6-10-seattle-showbox-michael-holden-100.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" title="Bassnectar @ Showbox,  Seattle 2010" src="http://www.bassnectar.net/wp-content/uploads/2-6-10-seattle-showbox-michael-holden-100.jpg" alt="Credit: Michael Holden" width="535" height="325" /></a><br />
Last week was a treat to be able to play 2 tiny venues in Colorado, it felt wonderful to be inside those rooms as they exploded. TO ALL OUR PALS IN COLORADO: we promise we will be back in Full Force Wildstyle later this year. And thanks also to the 2500 freaks in Montana who got dirty in the mud last night, that show was off the HOOOK! We are back to Missoula, Salt Lake City, and Lake Tahoe this week before we set sail for the Spring Tour, which kicks off March 27 @ the 2010 Ultra Music Festival in Miami.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="http://tour.bassnectar.net" target="_blank">tour schedule</a> for a full list of dates as well as discounted tickets. And… AVOID HIGH TICKET FEES! We always get a limited number of presale tickets, but if those sell out, visit the venue’s box office in person if possible. Some ticket companies apply fees of up to $18.We will always link to the cheapest tix available here on the site. Once those are gone, grab them direct for the venue and spare yourself the ridiculous service fees.</p>
<p>To coincide with the tour, we have a brand new 5-track EP for you, set for release on March 3o. It&#8217;s called the &#8220;<strong><em>Timestretch EP</em></strong>&#8221; and it is mostly banging melt-your-face-off music. There really isn&#8217;t a lot of the pretty, deeper stuff that i usually enjoy putting on albums; instead it is heavy, hard-hitting, and designed to CRUSH on our April run of shows.</p>
<div class="topspin-widget topspin-widget-bundle-widget" style="text-align: center;"><object width="300" height="250" data="http://cdn.topspin.net/widgets/bundle/swf/TSBundleWidget.swf?timestamp=1268023976" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="id" value="TSWidget16049" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="flashvars" value="highlightColor=0xC8A65B&amp;widget_id=http://app.topspin.net/api/v1/artist/38/bundle_widget/16049&amp;theme=black" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://cdn.topspin.net/widgets/bundle/swf/TSBundleWidget.swf?timestamp=1268023976" /></object></div>
<p>The release includes a collaboration with <strong>Amorphous Music</strong> prodigy <strong>Jantsen</strong>, as well as guest vocals by <strong>Ranking Joe</strong>, bonus remixes by <strong>MRK1, West Coast Lo Fi</strong>, and <strong>Hallow Point’s SPL</strong>, and a special <strong>Bassnectar &amp; ill.Gates</strong> remix of ‘<em><strong>Maximum</strong></em>’ featuring <strong>La Methode</strong> by <strong>DJ Vadim</strong>. You can grab the exclusive pre-release from Beatport starting March 15th, or get the bundles including the vinyl, CD, T-shirts, bonus remixes, collectors’ items, and more direct from the Bassnectar Labs on March 30th.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/2010/01/free-tickets-raffle-winner-bon-voyage/">Free Tickets, Raffle Winner, &#038; Bon Voyage</a></h3>
								<p>Hey folks!</p>
<p>As i run laps around the Bassnectar Labs trying to get ready to zooooom out onto the open road for the next 2 weeks, i wanted to give out a few passes to upcoming shows. I know a lot of you are planning on coming to 3 or 4 shows, and SOME OF YOU NUTTERS are doing the entire 5-city sweep next week. That is too bad ass to take lightly. SO&#8230;</p>
<p>I want to give away 1 Season Pass (a pair of free tickets to EACH of the 5 nights: Mendocino, Arcata, Eugene, Portland, Seattle&#8230; and if you win it and you are only hitting 3 or 4 shows you can give away the passes you don&#8217;t want to a buddy who does: we&#8217;ve got a system worked out! <img src='http://www.bassnectar.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Also i want to give away 1 pair of passes individually to each of the 5 nights, as well as Tempe, LA, and Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz and Arcata are both already sold out, but i&#8217;m just giving up my own guest list, cuz i think it would be cool to have another little cheeky competition.</p>
<p>So, here is the plot: we want to get the sickest, craziest photos of you showcasing your enthusiasm. We prefer to call it a bassface (that feeling of perfect disgusting delight right when a huge beat drops on your noggin, and the face you make in response) but you can do whatever you want. You can also do videos, like folks did last time.</p>
<p>Submissions will be judged on:</p>
<p>1. Level of Enthusiasm<br />
2. Uniqueness, Personality<br />
3. Intensity.</p>
<p>The photo must be OF YOU, or taken BY YOU, specifically for this (you can submit photos of yourself from a previous show if you really captured a moment, but we prefer if you make a new moment right here and now.</p>
<p>Runners up will receive a free pair of passes to the show in the area they specify, and the Winner will receive a season PASS.</p>
<p>INCLUDE YOUR NAME, EMAIL, and CITY WHERE YOU WANT YOUR PASS and submit your bassface to guests@bassnectar.net. If you are far away, only submit if you know someone in one of these cities whom you want to give a gift to. All set? We will announce the winners on Monday at noon, submissions must be in by 6pm PST, This Sunday January 31.</p>
<p>AND LASTLY THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT WITH THE REMIX PACK AND THE IDJ MIXTAPE!</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t checked out the Teleport Massive Remix yet:</p>
<span class="vvqbox vvqyoutube" style="width:575px;height:323px;"><span id="vvq-3815-youtube-1"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGCc0WqvVT4" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3815];player=swf;width=640;height=385;"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/oGCc0WqvVT4/0.jpg" alt="YouTube Preview Image" /></a></span></span>
<p>Our music store took a hit of acid and quadrupled in OOOOMF this week (Thanks Daysha!!!!) and you can now get music bundled with various things, in eclectic combinations. We will be unleashing some pretty sick bundles, but this first time we kept it pretty simple and just tested out some random ideas. The Collector&#8217;s Bundle was supposed to be limited to 30, and sold out almost immediately, so we added more. Each purchase of that bundle enters you into a raffle to snag an hour hanging out with me and the Crew, going through my laptop, doing remix stuff, swapping stories or tunes, or whatever. Since we will be running all over the states this tour, we will be giving way 3 raffle prizes instead of 1 and have arranged for 100 copies to be made available at <a href="Http://remixpack.bassnectar.net" target="_blank">remixpack.bassnectar.net</a>. Congrats to Chris Keller for winning the first draw. See you in Arcata, Chris!</p>
<p>MUCH LOVE!</p>

<p>And, as mentioned above, head over the to the mix set section at Bassnectar.net and enjoy some <a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/2010/01/2010-idj-mixtape" target="_self">FREE MUSIC: the new <strong>2010 IDJ Mixtape</strong></a>…. 44 minutes and 25 seconds of 10th-generation genre-re-wiring, exploring bass music through an open-minded lens, regardless of tempo, or even beat-structure… this sound clash aims straight for your body, with the intent to melt you down into a fidgeting, wobbling mess of enthusiasm and delight.</p>
<p>In addition to some of my favorite old records and samples, this mix features several brand new Bassnectar tracks, heaps of exclusive edits, re-edits, and re-re-re-edits. Lot’s of re. Lot’s of mix. Lot’s of edits. We tore our favorite drum &amp; bass to shreds, injected hip hop with some pogo-stick bass, amped up the tempo of dubstep, freaked out the gypsies, gave a nod to the dreamy 80’s and ended up similar to where we started off: omni-tempo maximalism strikes again.</p>
<p>I hope everyone is doing well out there, the new Decade is exploding and we are thrilled to be here living it with you!!!<br />
