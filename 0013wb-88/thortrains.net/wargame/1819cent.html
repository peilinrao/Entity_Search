"The Charge of the Light Brigade" is the quintessential tale of the "Horse
and Musket"era. &nbsp;It is a time of steady footsoldiers and dashing cavalry,
of barking cannons and ranks of musketeers. &nbsp;The Horse and Musket era
covers some of the most famous events in Western History. &nbsp;It embraces
the Seven Years War, French Revolution, Napoleonic Wars and Crimean Wars
of Europe, as well as the French &amp; Indians war, the Revolution, the War
of 1812, &nbsp;the Alamo, Mexican American War and Civil War in North America.
&nbsp;The Horse and Musket eras begins with great clashes between European
empires, and ends with the anecdotal Battle of Ridgeway in Canada.
<P>
What makes Horse and Musket Wargaming so popular? &nbsp;One would have a
difficult time assigning its appeal to any one factor. &nbsp;For some, it
is the colorful armies arrayed in bright uniforms. &nbsp;Others like the
clear-cut style of fighting ,with infantry ,cavalry and artillery having
well-defined missions and tactics. &nbsp;The sheer volume of historical research
and documentation of this era make it accessible to the novice and the
experienced wargamer. Likewise, many feel an affinity with these events of
the past, which were important parts of our own history. &nbsp;These are
the things we learned in our history classes, after all!
<P>
Horse and Musket is &nbsp;well-served with an awesome array of miniatures,
rules and literature. &nbsp;Numerous brands of supplies which vie for the
wargamer's money. &nbsp;Most major campaigns are well-served with rulesets,
board games and miniature figures. Makers produce almost every type and unit
of soldier that served from 1700 to 1870. &nbsp;Armies of the Napoleonic
Era and the American Civil War dominate Horse and Musket wargaming. &nbsp;They
are the best-supplied conflicts in the entire historical wargaming hobby.
<P>
If you like well-organized units of troops in formation, and the challenge
of pitting one formation against another, Horse and Musket will serve you
well!
