From the landsknechtes and Swiss pikemen to Musketeers and cavaliers, the
Renaissance is as eccentric as it gets. &nbsp;The fading Middle Ages meld
with the first inklings of Horse &amp; Musket. &nbsp;Renaissance warfare
combines mounted armored warriors with formations of fire-belching guns,
all under the muzzle of gunpowder artillery. &nbsp;And if that isn't enough,
there's the array of colorful uniforms and equally colorful armies. &nbsp;
<P>
Wargamers find tremendous variety in so short an era. &nbsp;The Renaissance
was a time of change. &nbsp;Feudalism was ceding power to national governments.
Religious changes sparked conflicts amid this era of governmental confusion.
&nbsp;The weapons were also changing, and the fully-armored knight started
losing precedence to armies of well-drilled commoners wielding pikes and
muskets. &nbsp;Artillery was reaching a new plateau. &nbsp;once limited in
effect, artillery became a major factor that could easily turn the course
of a battle.
<P>
The English-speaking world knows Renaissance warfare best via the English
Civil war, when Roundheads and Cavaliers faced off. &nbsp;In &nbsp;Northern
Europe it was the 30-Years War, a conflict sparked by religious differences,
political change and economic developments. &nbsp;In Eastern Europe, wars
against the Ottoman Empire typified the era. &nbsp;For the French, the era
included the adventures of The Three Musketeers. &nbsp;For those of a more
nautical bent, there were Explorations in the New World as well as the beginnings
of the Piratical Age. &nbsp;One could even include the adventures of
Conquistadores versus the indigenous armies of the lands they sought to overcome.
Renaissance personalities include the Borgias, Nicolo Machiavelli, Christopher
Columbus (a latecomer to the New World: remember, Leif landed first!), Cardinal
Richelieu, Oliver Cromwell and Ivan the Terrible.. &nbsp;
