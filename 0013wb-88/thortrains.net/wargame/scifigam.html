Our entire perception of :Outer Space" changed drastically, between 1959
and the present. &nbsp;In 1958, Space meant things like Captain Video.
&nbsp;Spacemen were those cool guys by Archer and Ajax with the space suits
that resembled Medieval armor, and "fishbowl" helmets. Then some guy named
Carpenter came along and went into space, in a suit that looked like a
chrome-plated fighter pilot's outfit. Space was instantly turned upside-down.
<P>
Science fiction made quite a journey in the next couple of decades. &nbsp;First
it was the phenomenal "Star Trek," an episodic series that showcased a captain
and crew facing adventures throughout the galaxy. &nbsp;The action was either
small skirmishes with ray pistols called "phasers", or ship-to-ship combat
using giant "phasers' and "photon torpedoes." &nbsp;"Star Trek" changed the
way we looked at outer space adventures. &nbsp;
<P>
A similar series, "Space 1999", had a crew who were a moon colony. &nbsp;The
Moon suddenly left orbit and the Solar System, leading to episodic adventures
not too different from the type encountered by the "Star Trek" crew. The
difference was that the "Star Trek" crew was militarized, and "Space 1999"
were civilians. &nbsp;"Space 1999" was not the stuff of wargames, but it
changed our thinking on science fiction. &nbsp;As for games, people were
already working on rules based on "Star Trek."
<P>
Television tried a few new things, including a remake of the old "Buck Rogers"
serial and a show about a nomadic fleet called "Battlestar Galactica."
&nbsp;Neither was inspiring to wargaming as a wild, wacky and thoroughly
fun space opera, "Star Wars." &nbsp;There was a show that had lots of intriguing
elements that would satisfy traditional gamers, science fiction gamers and
the newest group, fantasy role-playing gamers. Star Wars was released a couple
years after the original version of "Dungeons and Dragons." &nbsp;There were
armies, creatures and characters.
<P>
Wargamers did not have to depend on media for materials. &nbsp;As this was
going on, games were booming with new titles. &nbsp;Microgames and board
games and miniature games appeared, with the widest variety of science fiction
themes. &nbsp;There was Steve Jackson's "Ogre" on Microgames, "Warhammer"
for miniature games, and an oddball set of aliens called "Squats." &nbsp;Combat
ranged from role-playing character games to skirmish rules and fleet-size
space ship battles. &nbsp;Through it all, "Star Trek" remains one of the
favorite themes.
<P>
Science fiction gaming requires a pretty stable individual ,who can balance
out his enjoyment of the genre with the common sense to play a workable game.
&nbsp;Science Fiction Gamers require a strong sense of fun, in order to get
the most out of their games. &nbsp;The sheer variety within the genre is
thrilling, and almost anyone who is interested can find a specific them to
suit his wishes. &nbsp;
